      "question": "How do CMCSA, T, and VZ each reflect the strategic importance of wireless devices in their 2023 financial and operational disclosures, and what distinct roles do these devices play in their respective business models?",
      "answer": "CMCSA highlights wireless devices as a direct product cost, indicating that they are integral to service delivery through third-party networks. T emphasizes financing arrangements for wireless devices, showing a focus on customer acquisition and device trade-in programs as part of their sales strategy. VZ underscores dependency on wireless devices as critical components of their supply chain, noting risks related to global supply chain disruptions and vendor concentration. Together, this reveals that wireless devices are central to all three companies but serve different strategic functions\u2014cost of service for CMCSA, customer engagement and financing for T, and supply chain reliability for VZ.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company's stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the 'Record Date'), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\n\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical,  except  with  respect  to  voting.  Furthermore,  there  are  a  number  of  safeguards  built  into  our  certificate  of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends  on  our  Class  A,  Class  B,  and  Class  C  stock.  Specifically,  Delaware  law  provides  that  amendments  to  our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate  of  incorporation  provides  that  before  any  such  amendment  may  be  put  to  a  stockholder  vote,  it  must  be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\n\n",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n## Our stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly.

We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\n## Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and number of paid membership additions and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.

We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

Additionally, in November 2024, we agreed to purchase select spectrum licenses from United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) for approximately $1,000, subject to closing conditions, including the consummation of UScellular's proposed sale of its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nIn North America, our network covers over 440 million people with 4G LTE and over 314 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology.\n\nBroadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to ex pand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\n\nCopper Decommissioning While building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our ex it strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\n\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading 'Segment Results' in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Business, Cricket, AT&amp;T PREPAID , AT&amp;T Fiber and AT&amp;T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. SM\n\nMobility Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. \u00ae\n\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, tex t and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\n\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&amp;T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Spectrum\n\nThe spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile and fixed wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on the following low and mid-band spectrum in areas that collectively cover nearly all of the population of the U.S.: (i) the 700 M Hz Upper C block, (ii) Cellular spectrum (850 M Hz), (iii) Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum (1900 M Hz), (iv) AWS 1 and AWS 3 bands (1700 MHz uplink and 2100 M Hz downlink), and (v) the 3.7 GHz band (C-Band). We also hold spectrum licenses in the 28, Upper 37 and 39 GHz bands, known as millimeter wave spectrum, and utilize both Priority A ccess Licenses (PA Ls) and General A uthorized A ccess (GA A ) in the 3.5 GHz band (Citiz ens Broadband Radio Service).\n\nWe anticipate that demand for spectrum will continue to increase over time, driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We expect to meet the demand for 5G and 4G spectrum needs with our existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology , we can meet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur.\n\nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. We also gain access to spectrum through cross-lease transactions. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market.  Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency .  These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.\n\nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions, including our pending acquisition of select spectrum licenses of United States Cellular Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, is presented in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this A nnual Report.\n\n## Competition and Related Trends\n\nThe  telecommunications  industry  is  highly  competitive.  The  rapid  development  of  new  technologies,  services  and  products  has  eliminated  many  of  the distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and traditional telephone services and brought new competitors to our markets. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share.\n\nCompetitive factors within the telecommunications industry include, among others, network reliability , speed, capacity and coverage; pricing and promotional strategies; the quality of customer service; marketing, sales and distribution capabilities; development of new and enhanced products and services; the ability to anticipate and respond to various factors and trends affecting our industry; the availability of capital resources; and regulatory changes.\n\nCompetition remains intense as a result of various factors, including aggressive pricing, increased levels of promotions and service plan discounts, and offerings that include additional bundled premium content or other perks, in some cases specifically targeting V erizon customers. Competition may increase as smaller, stand-alone  wireless  service  providers  merge  or  transfer  licenses  to  larger,  better  capitalized  wireless  service  providers  and  as  M V NOs  resell  wireless communication services. In addition, aggressive network deployment as well as increasing government incentives related to it may enhance the ability of certain of our competitors to compete with us.\n\nWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including A T&amp;T Inc. and T-M obile US, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. W e also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service  providers,  including  V erizon,  and  resell  it  to  their  customers.  Resellers  include  cable  companies,  such  as  Comcast  Corporation  and  Charter Communications, Inc., and others. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships.\n\nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture market share with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, M icrosoft Corporation, A lphabet Inc., Apple Inc., M eta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we are seeing increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.\n\nWith  respect  to  Fios  and  our  other  broadband  services,  we  compete  against  cable  companies,  wireless  service  providers,  domestic  and  foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, low Earth orbit satellite companies, internet service providers, OTT providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and T each approach the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management strategies and financial reporting conservatism?",
      "answer": "CMCSA evaluates its uncertain tax positions by applying the 'more-likely-than-not' threshold and measures the benefit based on technical merits, with significant judgment applied in assessing business acquisitions, financing transactions, and income allocation across jurisdictions. DIS follows a similar recognition threshold but measures the tax benefit as the largest amount greater than 50% likely to be realized, reflecting a potentially more conservative stance in uncertain environments. T also applies the 'more-likely-than-not' recognition threshold and updates its unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) regularly, factoring in audit settlements, statute expirations, and tax law developments. While all three companies follow the same general GAAP framework, CMCSA emphasizes business combination complexities, DIS adopts a more probabilistic measurement approach, and T focuses on dynamic updates to UTBs, revealing differing emphases in risk mitigation and financial statement conservatism.",

      "answer": "Google pays content providers based on revenue generated or a flat fee for distribution on YouTube and Google Play, and these costs are included in 'other cost of revenues'. Meta pays fees to content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both, and these costs are expensed either per title or over the contractual license period, and are included in cost of revenue. Netflix depends heavily on licensing content from studios and providers, and its ability to offer content is contingent on securing distribution rights, which directly affects its membership growth and international regulatory exposure. When combined, these approaches show differing strategic priorities: Google and Meta treat content as a cost center tied to engagement and platform growth, while Netflix treats it as a core asset directly tied to subscriber acquisition and retention.",

        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Content Providers: Netflix depends on licensing rights from studios and content providers to offer content to members, and its ability to grow membership and comply with international regulations hinges on securing these rights."

      "answer": "CMCSA emphasizes its dependency on content providers for delivering programming to customers, indicating that access to high-quality content is critical to maintaining subscriber engagement and retention. GOOGL highlights the brand and reputational risks associated with third-party content shared on its platforms, showing that while content providers are important partners, they also pose challenges related to content moderation and brand integrity. META explicitly outlines financial commitments to content providers, including payments based on revenue, flat fees, or minimum guarantees, with content costs directly expensed as part of cost of revenue, demonstrating a direct financial dependency on licensing content to drive platform engagement. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies rely on content providers, the nature and implications of that reliance differ: CMCSA focuses on access, GOOGL on brand risk, and META on direct financial investment.",

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the ev olv ing nature of our business, our historical rev enue growth rate and historical operating margin may  not  be  indicativ e  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information,  see  T rends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  and  Rev enues  and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  reduce  the  value  of  our  products ,  s ervices ,  and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various ev ents outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, serv ices, and technologies. For example, effectiv e intellectual property protection may not be av ailable in ev ery country in which our products and serv ices are distributed or made av ailable through the Internet. Also, the efforts we hav e taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectiv e. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innov ations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innov ations. Moreov er, we may not hav e adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innov ations that later turn out to be important. T here is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. T he secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitiv e information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitiv e  adv antage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

GOOGL employs foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to offset translation risk from its foreign subsidiaries, with a projected $660 million impact on cumulative translation adjustment as of December 31, 2024, under a 10% USD weakening scenario. T uses foreign exchange forward contracts as part of its derivative strategy to manage foreign currency exchange risk, though it does not disclose a specific notional amount, indicating a more generalized risk management approach.

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

Fixed rate securities may hav e their fair market v alue adv ersely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase.

For ex ample, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the  United  States  and  internationally,  we  have  filed  various  applications  for  protection  of  certain  aspects  of  our  intellectual  property,  and  we  currently  hold  a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that  are  substantially  similar  to  ours  and  compete  with  our  business.  In  addition,  we  regularly  contribute  software  source  code  under  open  source  and  other permissive  licenses  and  have  made  other  technology  we  developed  available  under  such  licenses,  and  we  include  open  source  software  in  our  products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation  based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights.  In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to ex tract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other rights holders.\n\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, trademarks,  or  user  content,  infringe  their  intellectual  property  rights.  We  presently  are  involved  in  a  number  of  intellectual  property  lawsuits,  and  as  we  face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us",

In order to realize our core business strategy , we have developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with V erizon. Our strategy to build a workforce with talent, skills and motivation to give the company a competitive edge now and into the future rests on three pillars:\n\n- Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary skills and talent to execute on our business priorities.\n- Develop our employees' potential by offering educational opportunities that keep pace with changes occurring across our industry.\n- Inspire individuals to build a career at V erizon by providing meaningful work and opportunities for career advancement in a collaborative and inclusive environment.\n\nVerizon strives to be an employer of choice by offering our employees competitive compensation and benefits packages. We seek to recruit and retain employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. We provide extensive onthe-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally . A s of December 31, 2024, V erizon's global workforce was approximately 68.6% male, 31.1% female and 0.3% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 52.5% White, 18.4% Black, 14.0% Hispanic, 8.8% A sian, 0.4% A merican Indian / A laskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander, 2.6% two or more races, and 3.0% unknown or undeclared. Women represented 36.2% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented 34.0% of U.S. senior leadership.\n\nVerizon respects our employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable laws, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of A merica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - the two unions that in total represent approximately 25% of our employees as of December 31, 2024. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees who serve customers in our M id-A tlantic and Northeast service areas extend through A ugust 1, 2026. Other collective bargaining agreements covering smaller groups of employees extend through various dates between 2025 and 2028. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. V erizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety , customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.\n\nFor a discussion of V erizon's Board oversight of risks related to our human capital resources, see the section entitled \"Governance - Our governance framework - Oversight of business risks\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2025 Annual M eeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Patents, Trademarks and Licenses\n\nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of V erizon's brands and the results of V erizon's research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for V erizon, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.\n\nWe periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services.\n\n## Information About Our Executive Officers\n\nSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers.",

      "answer": "CMCSA projects continued significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock, with the timing of sporting events like the 2024 Olympics and the acquisition of NBA rights starting in 2025 influencing both revenue and programming expenses. DIS forecasts a total of $4,306 million in produced content for 2025, with a declining trend in both produced and licensed content over the next few years, indicating a cautious approach to content investment. VZ reports $16.7 billion in unconditional purchase obligations, with a substantial portion attributed to content commitments, including programming services based on subscriber counts and contract rates as of December 31, 2024. These figures suggest CMCSA is doubling down on streaming with Peacock, DIS is maintaining a high but potentially declining level of content spend, and VZ is locked into long-term content obligations that reflect a stable but inflexible strategy.",

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024 and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in 2025.\n\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content &amp; Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers G uild and the SAG  work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\n\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, V erizon ordinarily provides representations and warranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as indemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, V erizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPA s) with third parties. Each of the REPA s is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of 12 to 20 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Nineteen of the facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPA s generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities.\n\nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $16.7 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $6.2 billion is attributable to 2025, $5.5 billion is attributable to 2026, $3.1 billion is attributable to 2027, $1.3 billion is attributable to 2028, $291 million is attributable to 2029 and $363 million is attributable to years thereafter.  These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged.  Since  the  commitments  to  purchase  programming  services  from  television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2024, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.\n\n## Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange A ct of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this A nnual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effectiv e internal control established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is ongoing and is expected to continue over the next few years.\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. A s such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThere were no changes in V erizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control ov er financial reporting.",

      "answer": "Comcast actively hedges its foreign currency exposure, using both foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge $8.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, of net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of 2021. Netflix discloses that \u20ac5.17 billion of its $15.3 billion outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currency and reports a $431 million remeasurement gain for 2021, indicating exposure without explicit hedging. AT&T reports $41.25 billion in foreign currency debt across multiple currencies, including Euro, British pound, and Canadian dollar, but does not specify hedging strategies, suggesting a more passive or diversified approach to currency risk. Together, these disclosures reveal differing philosophies: Comcast actively manages currency risk, Netflix accepts exposure for potential gains, and AT&T maintains a diversified but less transparent stance.",

As  of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate estimated fair value of these cross-currency swaps was a net liability of $104 million and $376 million, respectively. The amount of pre-tax gains (losses) related to net investment hedges recognized in the cumulative translation  adjustments  component  of  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  were  gains  of  $760  million  in  2021,  losses  of  $686 million in 2020 and gains of $343 million in 2019.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a new $11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast's credit rating. As of  December  31,  2021,  the  borrowing  margin  for  borrowings  based  on  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  was  1.00%.  Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit  facility.  We  were  in  compliance  with  all  financial  covenants  for  all  periods  presented.  The  new  revolving  credit  facility replaced an aggregate $9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated.\n\nOur commercial paper program is supported by our revolving credit facility and provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund short-term working capital requirements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs or revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11 billion.\n\n## Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $341 million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.\n\n## Note 7: Significant Transactions\n\n## Universal Beijing Resort\n\nIn 2018, we entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park  and  resort  in  Beijing,  China  ('Universal  Beijing  Resort'),  which  opened  in  September  2021.  We  own  a  30%  interest  in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the  investors  in  accordance  with  their  equity  interests.  The  debt  financing,  which  is  being  provided  by  a  syndicate  of  Chinese financial  institutions,  contains  certain  covenants  and  a  maximum  borrowing  limit  of  \u00a529.7  billion  RMB  (approximately  $4.7 billion), which was increased from \u00a526.6 billion RMB (approximately $4.2 billion) in the third quarter of 2021. The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of December 31, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $3.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement.\n\nWe have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a VIE based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the  power  to  direct  activities  that  most  significantly  impact  its  economic  performance.  There  are  no  liquidity  arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss  is  our  30%  interest.  Universal  Beijing  Resort's  results  of  operations  are  reported  in  our  Theme  Parks  segment.  Our consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the 'construction of Universal Beijing Resort' and 'proceeds from borrowings' captions, respectively, and equity contributions from the noncontrolling interests are included in other financing activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $9.7 billion  and  $8.1  billion,  respectively.  The  assets  and  liabilities  of  Universal  Beijing  Resort  primarily  consist  of  property  and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.",

      "question": "How do Comcast (CMCSA), Netflix (NFLX), and AT&T (T) each quantify their exposure to foreign currency-denominated debt as of December 31, 2024, and what does this reveal about their differing international financial strategies?",
      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) reported foreign currency debt totaling \u00a33.3 billion, \u20ac8.5 billion, and \u00a522.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. Netflix (NFLX) disclosed \u20ac5,170 million in foreign currency-denominated notes, which are remeasured into U.S. dollars. AT&T (T) had approximately $30,685 million in foreign debt, including Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar denominated obligations. While all three companies maintain significant foreign currency liabilities, CMCSA and T have more diversified currency exposure across multiple regions, whereas NFLX\u2019s exposure is concentrated in euros.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, GOOGL, and META each structure their Class B common stock, and what does this reveal about their respective governance models and shareholder influence strategies?",
      "answer": "CMCSA discloses that it has issued and outstanding 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock with $0.01 par value, indicating a dual-class share structure that likely provides enhanced voting rights to certain shareholders. GOOGL explains that its Class B common stock carries 10 votes per share, compared to one vote per share for Class A, and that Class B shares automatically convert to Class A upon sale or transfer, reinforcing control by core insiders. META confirms that it has 343,761,117 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of January 24, 2025, suggesting a similar governance model where select shareholders retain disproportionate voting power. Together, these disclosures highlight a shared strategic use of dual-class structures among communication services firms to preserve founder or insider control despite public ownership.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, META, and NFLX each depend on or interact with third-party content, and what does this reveal about the varying degrees of risk and strategic importance each company places on external content providers?",
      "answer": "CMCSA depends heavily on third-party content for its linear television networks and streaming platforms like Peacock, and faces risks from content owners bypassing traditional distribution to go directly to consumers, which could reduce both content availability and licensing revenue. META notes that its ability to attract and retain user engagement is negatively impacted by the inability to obtain or attract engaging third-party content, which affects the relevance and quality of user experience on its platforms. NFLX relies on third-party studios and content providers to license distribution rights for content it offers globally, and faces risks from regulatory changes and content quotas that may limit its flexibility in content offerings. While all three companies rely on third-party content, CMCSA is exposed to shifts in licensing and distribution models, META is sensitive to content availability affecting user engagement, and NFLX faces regulatory and licensing constraints that impact global content delivery.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Third-Party Content: CMCSA licenses content from third parties such as movie studios and sports organizations, and faces risks when these providers launch their own DTC platforms, reducing both the quantity and quality of content available to CMCSA and impacting its revenue.",
        "Hop 2: META \u2192 Third-Party Content: META highlights that its platforms depend on attracting engaging third-party content, and failure to do so negatively affects user engagement and the relevance of its services.",
        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Third-Party Content: NFLX licenses content from third-party rights holders globally, and faces risks from regulatory changes such as content quotas and investment obligations that may restrict its content offerings in various jurisdictions."

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Meta each characterize their exposure to antitrust investigations, and what does this reveal about their respective legal risks and strategic responses in the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "Disney acknowledges facing antitrust investigations but provides no specific details or figures, indicating a more general exposure. Google, in contrast, details multiple ongoing and past investigations by the European Commission, DOJ, and other regulators, including fines exceeding \u20ac8 billion across three major cases involving shopping results, Android, and AdSense. Meta does not directly reference antitrust investigations but highlights regulatory scrutiny related to platform control and interoperability, particularly with Apple and Google, which indirectly reflects antitrust concerns around digital dominance. Together, these disclosures show that while all three face regulatory pressure, Google bears the most direct and quantifiable antitrust risk, while Disney and Meta face more indirect or structural scrutiny.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Antitrust Investigation: Disney discloses facing antitrust investigations but does not specify jurisdictions, outcomes, or financial impacts, suggesting a lower immediate legal exposure or a more cautious disclosure approach.",
        "Hop 2: GOOGL \u2192 Antitrust Investigation: Google provides detailed accounts of multiple EC decisions, including fines totaling over \u20ac8 billion across three major cases (shopping results, Android, and AdSense), ongoing appeals, and active investigations by the DOJ and international regulators into its advertising and app store practices.",
        "Hop 3: META \u2192 Antitrust Investigation: Meta does not explicitly reference antitrust litigation but discusses regulatory scrutiny over platform interoperability, particularly with Apple and Google, including limitations on ad targeting and measurement, which reflect concerns about digital market dominance and potential antitrust exposure."

META similarly depends on open-source software as part of its highly technical and complex systems, warning that errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in such software could adversely affect its business. NFLX acknowledges its reliance on open-source software and libraries integrated into its applications and tools, and notes that this increases exposure to vulnerabilities, particularly when combined with new features or upgrades. While all three companies recognize open-source software as a critical but risky component of their technology infrastructure, CMCSA emphasizes third-party accountability and regulatory exposure, META focuses on internal system complexity and potential bugs, and NFLX highlights the compounding risk from feature additions and generative AI.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## A cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those that are related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery and are embedded in our products and services, are critical to our business activities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by unauthorized parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hacking, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, malicious social engineering, theft, misconduct, fraud and other malicious activities. Incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns, human error, software or hardware failures or vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\n\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. For example, we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques, such as AI, that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks,  information  systems  and  other  technologies  across  the  world  and  create  latent  vulnerabilities  in  our  and  third-party  vendors'  systems  and  other technologies. We also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, that in many cases is provided or made available to third-party vendors who agree to protect it, which has in the past, and may in the future, become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form.  We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks  with  respect  to  such  third-party  suppliers  and  service  providers  and  their  products  and  services.  Due  to  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity breaches or incidents experienced by such third parties in relation to the information we share with them. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our third-party vendors, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\n\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused, and may from time to time in the future cause, a variety of business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security  of  our  internal  systems,  products,  services  or  satellite  transmission  signals,  power  outages,  and  the  compromise  or  ex filtration  of  sensitive,  personal, proprietary, confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data, and reputational impacts. In addition, despite efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, attacks can persist for an ex tended period of time before being detected, and following detection, it may take considerable time to understand the nature, scope, impact and timing of the incident. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. Repercussions of these incidents,  some  of  which  we  have  ex perienced  in  the  past,  could  include  litigation  or  cause  regulators  to  impose  significant  fines  or  other  remedial  measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.

However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.\n\nWe regularly experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents.  In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  United  States  and  abroad  relating  to  cybersecurity  and  data  protection, including the GDPR and EU member state laws implementing the EU Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2), as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, government authorities, affected users, or other parties could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of data, or other cybersecurity issues, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant ex pense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## Intentional misuse of our services and user data and other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intentional misuse of our services and user data by third parties, as well as other undesirable, illicit, or high-risk activity on our platform. We are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review efforts to combat these  activities,  including  investigations  and  audits  of  platform  applications,  as  well  as  other  enforcement  efforts.  We  have  discovered  and  announced,  and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable or illicit activity by third parties or malfeasant internal actors. We will not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC, government authorities, the media, or other third parties.\n\nSuch incidents and activities include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the ex istence of hacked, false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline (such as acts  of  violence,  terrorism,  improper  promotion  or  distribution  of  pharmaceuticals  and  illicit  drugs,  human  ex ploitation,  child  ex ploitation,  and  illegal  gaming), instances of spamming, surveillance, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation, or other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity. From time to time we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. We may also be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we began to implement in January 2025 to further free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies.\n\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and may in the future subject, us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\n\n## Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.\n\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third parties (including open source software and the operating systems and browsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives.

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider.

      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) incurs programming expenses based on per-subscriber fees under multiyear distribution agreements and emphasizes individual monetization of its content. Disney (DIS) categorizes its content into 'predominantly monetized individually' and 'predominantly monetized as a group,' with over $4.3 billion in content slated for release in 2025 alone. Verizon (VZ) has contractual obligations totaling $21.7 billion, including content purchases, with $3.23 billion in programming rights and advances committed for 2025. While CMCSA focuses on licensing third-party content and monetizing on an individual basis, DIS balances both individual and group monetization strategies, and VZ treats content as part of broader network and service commitments, reflecting distinct strategic roles for content in their business models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ntelevision  and  the  internet.  Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our businesses.\n\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and cybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any of these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Consumers' perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-party collaboration, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our Company across businesses and regions.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our other businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, brand damage may not be locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture may materially damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC business.\n\nWe may not successfully execute on our DTC strategy. The success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC businesses will be impacted by the success of our efforts to reorganize DMED to advance our DTC strategies, drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn in reaction to price increases, achieve the desired financial impact of the Disney+ ad supported service, pricing model and price increases, our ability to execute on cost realignment and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation, and allocation of programming and production costs is driven by distribution of the relevant content across windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business/distribution channel, including DTC. An increasing number of competitors have entered DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC streaming services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by an economic downturn. In addition, economic downturns negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and may not be successful in recruiting and retaining talent, or may face increased costs to do so. Our content may not successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations, may impact the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or experience higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC businesses.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been, and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As a result of the financial impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, Standard and Poor's downgraded our longterm debt ratings by two notches to BBB+ and downgraded our short-term debt ratings by one notch to A-2. Fitch downgraded our long- and short-term credit ratings by one notch to A- and F2, respectively. As of October 1, 2022 Moody's Investors Service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor's long- and shortterm debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. These ratings actions have increased, and any potential future",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that it incorporates extensive open-source software into many aspects of its products, services, and operations, exposing it to cyber attacks related to third-party suppliers and their products and services. META notes that its products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including open-source software, which may contain errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could compromise data protection and system reliability. NFLX specifically mentions reliance on open-source software and libraries integrated into various applications and systems, which may increase exposure to vulnerabilities, and emphasizes the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats targeting such systems. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies depend on open-source software, they each emphasize different aspects of risk\u2014CMCSA focuses on third-party exposure, META on internal system integrity and user data commitments, and NFLX on vulnerability to targeted attacks and misconfigurations.",

        "Hop 2: META \u2192 Open-Source Software: META acknowledges that its systems rely on open-source software and that vulnerabilities or bugs in such software could lead to compromised data protection, regulatory inquiries, or reputational damage, citing past incidents like the 2018 Facebook breach.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, META, and VZ each apply the measurement alternative for nonmarketable equity securities, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to valuing illiquid investments?",
      "answer": "CMCSA applies the measurement alternative to its nonmarketable equity securities, adjusting for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and records changes in value in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. META similarly uses the measurement alternative for substantially all of its nonmarketable equity securities, with a carrying value of $6.14 billion as of December 31, 2023, and performs a qualitative assessment to determine impairment. VZ also elects the measurement alternative for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, measuring these investments at cost, less impairment, plus or minus changes from observable price changes in orderly transactions. The synthesis reveals that all three companies rely on the measurement alternative to manage the complexity of valuing illiquid investments, though they differ in the scale of their holdings and the specific frameworks used for impairment testing and fair value adjustments.",

T, under its March 2014 authorization, has used Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchase agreements, with 144 million shares remaining available for repurchase as of December 31, 2023.

Verizon highlights specific financial obligations tied to FCC regulations, including $4.3 billion in 2023 for wireless license clearing costs related to Auction 107, and notes the capital investment required to deploy spectrum and maintain network infrastructure under regulatory guidelines.

      "question": "How do GOOGL, META, and NFLX each address the risks and dependencies associated with their relationships with advertisers, and what do their disclosures reveal about the varying degrees of advertiser influence on their business models and reputational exposure?",
      "answer": "GOOGL discloses that it indemnifies advertisers under certain agreements and has potential future liabilities tied to these arrangements, though no material claims were probable or reasonably possible as of December 31, 2023. META highlights that advertiser actions can impact its brand reputation and that it faces regulatory and media scrutiny over advertising practices, which has historically affected user trust and could continue to do so. NFLX acknowledges limited experience in advertising and outlines multiple risks tied to advertiser adoption, including the need to attract and retain advertisers, manage member dissatisfaction, and develop the necessary infrastructure and sales team to support ad-based revenue growth. Together, these perspectives show that while all three rely on advertisers, they face distinct challenges ranging from legal exposure (GOOGL), reputational risk (META), and operational scaling (NFLX).",

We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases/protective covers and wireless chargers. We sell online and through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. We provide our customers the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. Subscribers that bring their own devices or retain handsets for longer periods impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide postpaid contract subscribers promotional equipment offers to initiate, renew or upgrade service.\n\nBusiness Wireline Our Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, and governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer fiber and other advanced connectivity services, such as AT&amp;T Dedicated Internet, fiber ethernet and broadband, fixed wireless, and hosted and managed professional services, as well as legacy voice and other transitional services comprised of copper-based voice and data, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), wholesale, outsourcing and IP sales. Historically, a majority of our Business Wireline service revenues came from legacy copper-based voice and data and traditional products; however, over recent years those services have been declining due to secular pressures.\n\nWe continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services, and rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers' digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. Some of the services we have offered historically are in secular decline and, going forward, we will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber as well as evaluating opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment revenues include customer premises equipment.\n\nConsumer Wireline - Our Consumer Wireline business unit provides broadband services, including fiber connections, AIA and legacy telephony voice communication services, to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network. Our Consumer Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: broadband, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.\n\n## Broadband Service\n\nWe provide broadband and internet services to approximately 14.1 million customers, including 9.3 million fiber broadband subscribers at December 31, 2024. With changes in video viewing preferences and the impacts of remote learning trends, we are experiencing increasing demand for high-speed broadband services. We believe our investment in expanding our industry-leading fiber network positions us to be a leader in wired connectivity. Our focus on fiber brings owners economics and expected efficiencies while we continue to evaluate opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure.\n\nWe believe that our flexible platform, with a broadband and wireless connection, is the most efficient way to transport direct-to-consumer video and data experiences both at home and on mobile devices. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations.\n\n## Legacy Voice and Data Services\n\nRevenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internetbased providers.\n\n## Other Service and Equipment\n\nOther service revenues include VoIP services, customer fees and equipment.\n\nAdditional information on our Communications segment is contained in the 'Overview' section of Item 7.\n\n## LATIN AMERICA\n\nOur Latin America segment provides wireless service in Mexico. We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. The Latin America segment provided approximately 3% of 2024 segment operating revenues and less than 1% of our 2024 total segment operating income.

      "answer": "CMCSA describes its Media segment as directly competing with television networks for viewers' attention and advertising revenue, noting that declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition and audience fragmentation due to the growing number of entertainment choices. DIS similarly positions itself in direct competition with television networks for both audience share and advertising dollars, emphasizing that competitive pressures raise programming costs and limit pricing power for its linear networks. In contrast, VZ has contractual obligations to television networks as part of its content acquisition strategy, estimating its commitments based on subscriber numbers and contract rates, indicating a dependency on traditional network programming for its service offerings. This reveals that CMCSA and DIS are leveraging content creation and distribution to compete in a fragmented market, while VZ is strategically positioned as a distributor reliant on network content, highlighting divergent approaches to navigating the shift toward streaming and digital platforms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided over the contract period. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging  from 2  years  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  to  up  to 5  years  for  larger  enterprises.  Customers  with  contracts  may  only  discontinue  service  in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual Business Services Connectivity segment revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers under contract typically pay on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\n## Media Segment\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days.  In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of television programming in the United States and internationally to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment, and to virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. This revenue includes amounts under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, and we also receive associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly subscription fees for our Peacock service either directly from customers or from companies who sell Peacock to customers on our behalf. We have determined that we are principal in these arrangements and in the event we do not have transparency into the pricing charged by a company selling Peacock on our behalf, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the fees receivable from that company pursuant to our arrangement.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fix ed fee. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Stock-Based Compensation\n\n## Verizon Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn M ay 2017, our shareholders approved the 2017 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated the Company's authority to grant new awards under the V eriz on 2009 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, we reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise terminated will also be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, 50 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. The RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of  V erizon common stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. In 2020, V erizon announced a broad-based program that provides for the annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards and the liability  is measured at its fair v alue at the end of each reporting period. A ll RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time the RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award.\n\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\n## Performance Stock Units\n\nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. A s defined by the 2017 Plan,  the  Human  Resources  Committee of the  Board of  Directors  determines  the  number  of  PSUs  a  participant  earns  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle.

In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 36 million.\n\nDisney+ and Disney+ Hotstar offer content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar revenue is derived from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. The Company offers an adsupported Disney+ service in the U.S., Canada and select Latin American and European markets.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a domestic subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising. Hulu offers subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service. The Live TV service is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as Max, Cinemax, Starz and Paramount+ with Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC Network, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after the linear airing on these channels. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 52 million.\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/VOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/VOD Distribution\n\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nNetflix , Inc. (the 'Company') was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical ex perience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 22040): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific ex pense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\n\n## Recently adopted accounting pronouncements\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\n\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Shortterm investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in 'Interest and other income (ex pense)' in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in 'Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)' within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and GOOGL each characterize their relationship with YouTube TV, and what does this reveal about the platform's competitive positioning, legal exposure, and revenue significance in the broader streaming ecosystem?",
      "answer": "CMCSA identifies YouTube TV as a direct competitor in the virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) market, highlighting its role in the competitive landscape for video services. DIS is involved in legal disputes with YouTube TV, as it faces antitrust lawsuits from subscribers alleging that DIS uses restrictive pricing and packaging provisions in carriage agreements to inflate prices and reduce output. GOOGL, as the producer of YouTube TV, includes the service as a core component of its consumer subscriptions revenue, alongside services like YouTube Music and Premium, indicating its strategic importance to Google's broader content ecosystem. Together, these perspectives reveal that YouTube TV is a significant competitive force in the streaming market, faces legal scrutiny over content distribution practices, and plays a key revenue-generating role for Google within the evolving digital video landscape.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Spectrum Allocations\n\nThe FCC, the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other federal agencies have taken, and in some cases are preparing to take, steps to evaluate and potentially modify certain spectrum allocations and rules to make available additional spectrum that likely will be used for licensed and/or unlicensed commercial services, including 5G  and Wi-Fi services, which could impact our businesses. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these spectrum allocation actions. Additional commercial spectrum could impact current marketplace dynamics, including the ability of wireless providers to compete with our services. Further, if the FCC reallocates spectrum that our businesses currently use to provide services, we could be required to transition our operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\n\n## International Communications-Related and Other Regulations\n\nCertain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation, including those related to broadband and voice services and television networks, in Europe, Latin America, and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection, and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.\n\n## Other Areas of Regulation\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs/Blu-rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to ex pend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal  protections  ex ist  to  combat  such  practices,  the  ex tent  of  copyright  protection  is  sometimes  ambiguous  and  the  use  of  technological  protections  can  be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of ex isting laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\n## Privacy and Data Protection Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals' personal information. In the United States, federal privacy laws and regulations, such as those found within the Communications Act or the V ideo Privacy Protection Act, restrict companies' collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. The proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers' rights to include individual rights of access, deletion, portability, correction, the right to appeal, and the individual's right to 'opt in' to collection and use of certain types of 'sensitive'  personal  information.  Internationally,  many  of  the  laws  that  apply  to  our  businesses  are  similar  to  the  European  Union's  G eneral  Data  Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act of 2018, which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

These laws require organizations that process the personal data of EU and UK citizens to comply with certain data protection standards and privacy rights, including requirements to implement privacy by design; parental consent for processing children's data; detailed privacy notices and related consents; breach notifications; and data subject rights to enforce access, rectification, objection, restriction, portability and deletion.\n\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that are intended to protect the privacy of children online, including the Children's Online Protection Privacy Act, a U.S. federal law that requires websites and online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, as well as codes of conduct relating to the design of digital products and services likely to be accessed by children, such as the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code. These laws, regulations and codes of conduct have an impact on the marketing of our products and services, the advertising on certain of our and third-party digital platforms that distribute our content and the design of certain of our new media offerings.\n\nIn addition, U.S. state laws and many international data protection laws require notifications to consumers and regulators in the event of a data breach, mandating that businesses provide consumers and/or government agencies notice of unauthorized access or disclosure of certain information.\n\nInterpretation of privacy and data protection laws and enforcement priorities continue to evolve and in some cases, regulators seek to apply novel interpretations of ex isting laws.\n\nCompliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations entails significant investments and is costly and requires us to employ dedicated compliance personnel and processes. In addition, many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, private rights of action for damages and other relief.\n\n## International Content Regulation\n\nThe laws and regulations in many international jurisdictions in which we operate, including in the EU and Canada, require our linear networks or our DTC streaming services to include a certain amount of programming produced in specific jurisdictions or languages or require us to invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content or to acquire content produced by local independent production companies. In addition, some countries regulate the content of films and television programming, which can impact our ability to distribute certain content in those jurisdictions or can require us to make adjustments to the films or programming. These laws and regulations increase our costs and impact our ability to operate our DTC streaming services and linear networks and distribute our films and programming in these markets.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available without charge on our website, www.disney.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWe also use our Investor Relations website as a means of disclosing material non-public information. We may also use our Investor Relations website for the purpose of complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Disney to review the information we post on our Investor Relations website.\n\nWe are providing the address to our website solely for the information of investors. We do not intend our website address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of the website into this report.\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRY\n\n## Declines in U.S., global and regional economic conditions adversely affect the profitability of our businesses.\n\nDeclines in economic conditions, such as recessions, other less severe slowdowns in economic activity and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business typically adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or costs to operate our businesses, reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced or resulted in slower growth than expected in, among other things, guest spending at our parks and resorts, purchases of and prices for advertising on our platforms and purchases of Company-branded consumer products, and we expect similar impacts as such conditions recur. Recent inflationary conditions increased certain of our costs, including at our parks",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- Privacy and data protection - We are subject to local, state, federal and international laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy A ct, Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and a number of other privacy laws more recently adopted by  other  states  and  countries  include  significant  penalties  for  non-compliance.  Generally ,  attention  to  priv acy   and  data  security   requirements  is increasing at all levels of government globally , and privacy-related legislation has been introduced or is under consideration in many locations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.\n- Regulation of broadband internet access services - V eriz on offers many different broadband services. In early January 2025, based on litigation filed by the broadband industry , a federal appeals court overturned the FCC's A pril 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications A ct. A bsent further action in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity , several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New Y ork that requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to \"digital discrimination\" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in court.\n- \"Open access\" - We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. M oreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.\n- Climate-related  regulation  and  policy -  Due  to  the  nature  of  our  operations,  we  hav e  been,  and  ex pect  to  continue  to  be  impacted  by   regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.\n\nThese developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.\n\n## Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretations, and challenges to our tax positions.\n\nTax laws and regulations are complex, dynamic, and subject to change and varying interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, tax  liabilities, and the carry ing v alue of deferred tax  assets or deferred tax  liabilities. A ny  of these changes could materially  impact our financial performance and our tax provision, net income and cash flows.\n\nWe are also subject to ongoing audits, examinations and other tax controversies in various jurisdictions. A lthough we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these controversies to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. In the event that we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\n\nWe are subject to a substantial amount of litigation and claims in arbitration, including, but not limited to, shareholder lawsuits, patent and copyright infringement lawsuits, wage and hour class actions, contract and commercial claims, personal injury claims, property claims, environmental claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. W e may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards of damages or settlements. We also could be subject to court-ordered injunctions and other remedies that could negatively impact our business operations. Our wireless business is also subject to lawsuits relating to alleged adverse health effects of wireless phones and radio frequency transmitters. A ny of these allegations or changes in government agencies' assessment of the risks associated with using wireless devices could result in significant legal and regulatory liability  and other remedies, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.",

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content. T he costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.",

AT&T (T) highlights its investment in 5G as part of broader network modernization, signaling a balanced approach between maintaining legacy systems and advancing new technologies. Verizon (VZ) provides the most detailed perspective, noting a $10 billion accelerated capital program for C-Band spectrum deployment and $18.8 billion in total capital expenditures in 2023, with full access to C-Band spectrum achieved by August 2023, covering approximately 242 million people in the U.S. This comparative analysis shows that while all three companies are investing in 5G, Verizon is leading with the most aggressive and transparent deployment strategy, positioning itself for dominant market share in 5G wireless services.",

      "question": "How do Comcast, Meta, and Netflix each quantify or characterize their financial exposure to content providers in their 2024 disclosures, and what does this reveal about their relative dependency on external content licensing?",
      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) highlights its dependency on content providers without disclosing specific financial figures, noting that its business relies on relationships with studios and distributors to provide content to customers. Meta (META) reports $2.06 billion in advertising expenses for 2024, which includes payments to content providers for licensed video and music aimed at increasing platform engagement. Netflix (NFLX) emphasizes its extensive licensing arrangements with studios and rights holders, noting that its ability to offer content depends on these third-party licenses, though it does not provide a specific dollar figure for content licensing costs. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies depend on content providers, Meta explicitly quantifies a significant portion of its financial commitment, Netflix underscores the strategic and regulatory importance of licensing, and Comcast focuses on the operational necessity without disclosing financial exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Content Costs\n\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

      "answer": "Meta highlights that it is involved in multiple intellectual property lawsuits and expects the number of claims to grow as it develops new products, which could lead to costly litigation, injunctions, and reputational damage. Netflix notes that defending IP claims is expensive and diverts key personnel, and it may be forced to remove content or adjust its business practices if claims are upheld, which could impact its competitive position. Verizon, while not currently facing a material impact from IP claims, acknowledges receiving notices alleging infringement and states that such claims could require it to pay damages, rebrand, or stop offering certain services. While all three companies face IP-related risks, Meta emphasizes ongoing litigation exposure, Netflix focuses on the cost and disruption of defending claims, and Verizon takes a more passive stance, noting that IP-related revenue from licensing is valuable but not material to its overall operations.",

For ex ample, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the  United  States  and  internationally,  we  have  filed  various  applications  for  protection  of  certain  aspects  of  our  intellectual  property,  and  we  currently  hold  a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that  are  substantially  similar  to  ours  and  compete  with  our  business.  In  addition,  we  regularly  contribute  software  source  code  under  open  source  and  other permissive  licenses  and  have  made  other  technology  we  developed  available  under  such  licenses,  and  we  include  open  source  software  in  our  products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation  based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights.  In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to ex tract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other rights holders.\n\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, trademarks,  or  user  content,  infringe  their  intellectual  property  rights.  We  presently  are  involved  in  a  number  of  intellectual  property  lawsuits,  and  as  we  face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us",

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider.

In order to realize our core business strategy , we have developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with V erizon. Our strategy to build a workforce with talent, skills and motivation to give the company a competitive edge now and into the future rests on three pillars:\n\n- Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary skills and talent to execute on our business priorities.\n- Develop our employees' potential by offering educational opportunities that keep pace with changes occurring across our industry.\n- Inspire individuals to build a career at V erizon by providing meaningful work and opportunities for career advancement in a collaborative and inclusive environment.\n\nVerizon strives to be an employer of choice by offering our employees competitive compensation and benefits packages. We seek to recruit and retain employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. We provide extensive onthe-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally . A s of December 31, 2024, V erizon's global workforce was approximately 68.6% male, 31.1% female and 0.3% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 52.5% White, 18.4% Black, 14.0% Hispanic, 8.8% A sian, 0.4% A merican Indian / A laskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander, 2.6% two or more races, and 3.0% unknown or undeclared. Women represented 36.2% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented 34.0% of U.S. senior leadership.\n\nVerizon respects our employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable laws, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of A merica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - the two unions that in total represent approximately 25% of our employees as of December 31, 2024. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees who serve customers in our M id-A tlantic and Northeast service areas extend through A ugust 1, 2026. Other collective bargaining agreements covering smaller groups of employees extend through various dates between 2025 and 2028. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. V erizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety , customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.\n\nFor a discussion of V erizon's Board oversight of risks related to our human capital resources, see the section entitled \"Governance - Our governance framework - Oversight of business risks\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2025 Annual M eeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Patents, Trademarks and Licenses\n\nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of V erizon's brands and the results of V erizon's research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for V erizon, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.\n\nWe periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services.\n\n## Information About Our Executive Officers\n\nSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers.",

The payments for content assets increased $4,933 million, from $12,537 million to $17,469 million, or 39%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of content assets of $1,423 million, from $10,807 million to $12,230 million, or 13%. The increase in payments for content assets was primarily driven by delays in productions resulting from the pandemic that impacted the prior year, which resulted in the timing of certain production payments being shifted into the current year. In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service and our international expansion.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $834 million, primarily due to acquisitions.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $2,387 million primarily due to no debt issuances in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,002 million, net of $8 million issuance costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, coupled with the repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $600 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and repayment upon maturity of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375% Senior Notes in February 2021.\n\nFree cash flow was $5,275 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to $5,239 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense, $431 million of non-cash remeasurement gain on our euro-denominated debt and $8 million other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $403 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nFree cash flow was $840 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to $1,730 million of cash payments for content assets over amortization expense and $308 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $533 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, $415 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, and a $250 million non-cash valuation allowance on the California R&amp;D credit.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV",

In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions.

Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fix ed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in ex change rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain ex posures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Cost of Revenues' to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA's tiered Peacock strategy with NFL and Olympics streaming rights, NFLX's global original content investment, and T's network infrastructure positioning each reflect distinct financial and strategic approaches to scaling their roles in the streaming content ecosystem?",
      "answer": "CMCSA leverages a tiered monetization model through Peacock, offering free ad-supported, subscription-based ad-supported, and ad-free tiers, while securing major sports streaming rights like the NFL (including Sunday Night Football and Super Bowl games through 2033\u201334) and Olympics coverage through 2032. These rights are distributed across NBC networks and Peacock, underpinning its streaming content strategy with high-traffic live events. NFLX, in contrast, relies on a subscription-only model without ads and focuses heavily on global original content investment to drive membership growth across over 190 countries. This strategy is reflected in its content amortization and investment plans, which aim to diversify programming and attract new members. T does not produce or distribute streaming content directly but plays a foundational infrastructure role, enabling the delivery of streaming services through its network capabilities. Its positioning centers on supporting the growing bandwidth demands of streaming platforms rather than monetizing content directly. Together, these three companies illustrate distinct value chain roles: CMCSA as a vertically integrated content producer and distributor, NFLX as a global direct-to-consumer platform, and T as the underlying network enabler.",

The  Peacock  app  is  available  to  consumers  over  the  internet  directly  and  through distributors and other platforms in the United States, including to Cable Communications X1 and Flex customers. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, certain ad-supported Peacock programming was also integrated into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\n## Programming\n\nOur television and streaming platforms include content licensed from our Studios segment and from third parties, as well as content produced by Media segment businesses, such as live news and sports programming and certain original programming, including late-night comedy for NBC and original telenovelas for Telemundo.\n\nWe have various multiyear contractual commitments for the licensing of programming, including contracts related to broadcast rights for sporting events. We generally seek to include in our sports rights agreements the rights to distribute content on one or more  of  our  television  networks  and  on  digital  platforms,  including  Peacock.  Our  most  significant  sports  rights  commitments include the following:\n\n- NFL: Agreements to produce and broadcast a specified number of regular season and playoff games, including Sunday Night Football on our NBC network and four Super Bowl games, the next of which is in February 2022, through the 203334 season, with a termination right available to the NFL after the 2029-30 season. These agreements include certain other rights, including streaming rights, additional exclusive games on Peacock and the Spanish-language U.S. broadcast rights for certain NFL games, which are aired on Telemundo\n- Olympics: U.S. broadcast rights for the summer and winter Olympic Games through 2032 with programming aired across the NBC network, multiple cable networks and on Peacock\n\nWe  also  have  U.S.  broadcast  rights  to  PGA  TOUR  and  other  golf  events  through  2031,  Worldwide  Wrestling  Entertainment ('WWE') events through 2026, certain NASCAR events through 2024 and the Spanish-language U.S. broadcast rights to FIFA World Cup soccer games through 2026, as well as local broadcast rights for certain professional sports teams through our regional sports networks with terms ending between 2024 and 2040.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\nNBCUniversal's film and television studio production and distribution operations primarily comprise our Studios segment.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from licensing our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to cable, broadcast and premium networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-perview  services  provided  by  multichannel  video  providers  and  OTT  service  providers;  from  the  worldwide  distribution  of  our produced and acquired films for exhibition  in  movie  theaters;  and  from  the  sale  of  owned  and  acquired  content  on  DVDs  and through digital distribution services. We also generate revenue from the production and licensing of live stage plays.\n\n## Film Studios\n\nOur  film  studios  develop,  produce,  acquire,  market  and  distribute  filmed  entertainment  worldwide.  Our  films  are  produced primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Pictures\n- Illumination\n- DreamWorks Animation\n- Focus Features\n- Working Title\n\nThe majority of our films are initially distributed for exhibition in movie theaters, while other titles are produced and distributed direct-to-video.  Certain  theatrical  titles  are  also  made  available  for  viewing  on  demand  following  a  shortened  theatrical  release window. After their initial release, we sell and license films globally through various methods. We license films, including titles following the theatrical release window and selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to DTC streaming  service  providers,  and  to  video  on  demand  and  pay-per-view  services  provided  by  multichannel  video  providers, including the Cable Communications and Sky segments. We also distribute films globally by selling them on DVDs and through digital distribution services.\n\nTheatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices and the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

DIS notes that the shift from licensing content to third parties to distributing it directly through their DTC streaming services has affected their TV/SVOD distribution revenue, indicating a strategic move to retain content value internally. NFLX emphasizes the increasing cost of content licensing, the risk of studios withdrawing popular content as they launch their own streaming platforms, and the challenges of negotiating with collection management organizations, which could lead to service disruptions or increased costs.

Although COVID-19 continues to impact our theatrical distribution business in certain markets, the impact in fiscal 2021 was more significant due to theater closures and capacity restrictions in many territories in which we operate. Titles released in the current year included Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness , Thor: Love and Thunder , Eternals , Encanto and Lightyear. Titles released in the prior year included ShangChi &amp; The Legend of The Ten Rings , Black Widow and Free Guy .\n\nThe decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to lower unit sales despite the benefit of more new release titles in the current year. Net effective pricing was comparable to the prior year as lower unit pricing was offset by a higher mix of new release titles, which have a higher sales price than catalog titles.\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to more stage play performances in the current year as productions were generally shut down in the prior year due to COVID-19.\n\nOperating expenses are as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

X1 and Sky Q are cloud-based platforms that provide integrated search functionality leveraging set-top boxes and voice-activated remote controls. The integrated features operate across content in customers' video service packages and content from internet-based streaming services that customers may access in a manner similar to our Xumo Stream Box. We offer a range of video packages from basic linear service to full linear service, which typically include free-to-air networks and a range of other linear television networks including premium, sports and news networks. Our international video packages also include Sky-branded entertainment television networks that offer entertainment, premium movie and free-to-air programming, as well as Sky Sports networks that are part of our Media segment. Customers may also subscribe to digital video recorder ('DVR') services or access our video on demand services with programming that is available for no additional cost or to rent or buy digitally. These viewing options are also available through our mobile apps and online portals.\n\nWe also offer DTC streaming services marketed under the NOW brand, with an offering in the United States that launched in 2023. NOW services provide video content over the internet and do not require a set-top box. Our international NOW service offerings include packages for monthly access to entertainment, sports and movie programming, as well as daily pass options for sports programming.  Our domestic  NOW  TV  service is only offered to qualifying residential broadband customers  and  includes  monthly  access  to  a  variety  of  linear  television  networks;  entertainment  and  movie  programming;  integrated  access  to  free  streaming channels from Xumo Play, NBC and Sky; and access to the ad-supported tier of Peacock.\n\nWe also offer video services in the United Kingdom and Italy over a broadband connection without the need for a satellite dish. These services have an operating system similar to Sky Q and are offered to customers through Sky Stream, which leverages a streaming device and Wi-Fi, or to customers that purchase our Sky G lass smart televisions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nAs part of our distribution agreements with domestic cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that our advertising business sells, and we also sell advertising on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks and on our digital platforms. We also enter into representation agreements under which we sell advertising on behalf of third parties both domestically and internationally. Additionally, we offer technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate effective engagement of advertisers with their target audiences.\n\n## Other\n\nWe offer residential wireline voice services primarily using interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol ('V oIP') technology, and we offer residential security and automation  services.  We  also  license  our  technology  platforms  to  other  multichannel  video  providers  and  distribute  certain  of  our  Sky-branded  entertainment television networks to third-party video service providers.\n\n## Business Services Connectivity Segment\n\nOur Business Services Connectivity segment consists of our domestic service offerings for small businesses, which include broadband, wireline voice and wireless services, as well as our enterprise solutions offerings for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Certain business customers subscribe to our video services, and the associated revenue is included in our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment. We also have certain business connectivity service offerings in the United Kingdom.\n\nOur domestic broadband offerings have a range of service levels, including fiber-based services that deliver symmetrical speeds ranging up to 100 gigabits per second.\n\nOur small business broadband, wireline voice and wireless service offerings are similar to those provided to our residential customers and also include cloud-based cybersecurity services, wireless backup connectivity, advanced Wi-Fi solutions, video monitoring services and other cloud-based services.\n\nOur enterprise solutions offerings also include ethernet network services, which connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, advanced voice services, and a software-defined networking product. Larger enterprises may also receive support services related to Wi-Fi networks, router management, network security, business continuity risks and other services.

The FCC's rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fix ed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers' prices and service offerings have historically not been subject to prescriptive regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.\n\nThe Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our interstate telecommunications services. In addition, our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.\n\nWe continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further ex tended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.\n\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.",

We have the right to bill the customer as service is provided over time, which results in our right to the payment being unconditional. The contract asset balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other and Other assets. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management's expectation of the asset's collectability .\n\nContract assets increased $128 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. The change in contract assets was primarily due to new contracts and increases  in  sales  promotions  recognized  upfront,  driven  by  customer  activity  related  to  wireless  and  Fios  services.  These  items  were  partially  offset  by reclassifications to accounts receivable due to billings on existing contracts and impairment charges of $53 million.\n\nContract liabilities arise when we bill our customers and receive consideration in advance of providing the goods or services promised in the contract. We typically bill serv ice one month in advance, which is the primary component of the contract liability balance. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when services are provided to the customer. The contract liability balances are presented in our consolidated balance sheets as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities.\n\nContract liabilities increased $776 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. The change in contract liabilities was primarily due to increases in sales promotions recognized over time, upfront fees and wireless pricing actions.\n\nRevenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to contract liabilities existing at January 1, 2024 and 2023 were $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, as performance obligations related to services were satisfied.",

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that weak economic conditions and high interest rates negatively impact their pricing models due to consumer sensitivity and potential service churn. NFLX's reliance on AWS cloud infrastructure exposes their pricing model to potential disruptions or cost increases from a single provider, limiting flexibility. T's exposure to investment securities, particularly those valued using pricing models and discounted cash flows, introduces volatility that influences their pricing strategies. Together, these factors show how economic sensitivity, infrastructure dependency, and financial asset volatility each uniquely pressure the companies' pricing models in the communication services sector.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Problems faced by us or our thirdparty 'cloud' computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\n\n## We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\n\nAmazon Web Services ('AWS') provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any commercial disputes related to, disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\n\n## If the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own CDN. To the extent Internet Service Providers ('ISPs') do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we ex perience difficulties in our CDN's operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of thirdparties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of 'bugs' or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain ex isting members and add new members may be impaired. Any harm to our members' devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\n\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help counterbalance these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\n\n## Risks Related to Privacy\n\n## Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could adversely impact our business and reputation.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our advertising offering, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members and third parties, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or 'GDPR') and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"). Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, have and could in the future lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, which to date have not been material but",

GOOGL uses a combination of forward and option contracts, including collars, to hedge British Pound risk, with a 10% adverse exchange rate movement potentially impacting income by $503 million as of 2023.

      "question": "How do Google, Meta, and Verizon differ in their treatment of non-lease components within lease arrangements, particularly regarding fixed versus variable payments and their impact on financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Google combines fixed payments for non-lease components (e.g., maintenance and utilities) with lease payments and accounts for them together as a single lease component, increasing lease assets and liabilities. Meta also combines fixed non-lease components (e.g., maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees) with lease payments, but separately accounts for variable lease costs such as CPI-affected payments and utility costs, which are expensed as incurred. Verizon similarly combines non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance costs) with lease components for substantially all asset classes when acting as a lessee, while variable payments such as real estate taxes and utility usage are expensed in the period incurred. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies follow a similar policy of integrating fixed non-lease components into lease liabilities, they differ in the categorization and treatment of variable components, which affects the timing and magnitude of expense recognition.",

      "question": "How do the clawback policy disclosures from Disney, Netflix, and AT&T in their 2024 SEC filings compare in terms of implementation timing and stated approach to executive compensation accountability?",
      "answer": "Disney filed its Clawback Policy as part of its 2024 10-K report, specifically listing it as Exhibit 97 with no incorporation by reference, indicating a standalone disclosure filed concurrently with the annual report. Netflix introduced its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97.1 in its 2024 10-K filing, explicitly referencing it as part of its annual report materials and filed on January 26, 2024. AT&T disclosed its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97, incorporated by reference from its 2023 10-K filing, suggesting continuity in policy from the prior year. While all three companies disclose clawback policies as part of their SEC filings, Disney and Netflix both filed updated versions in 2024, whereas AT&T's policy remains unchanged from 2023. This reveals differing approaches: Disney and Netflix emphasize current policy alignment with 2024 governance standards, while AT&T maintains its prior-year policy, potentially signaling a more stable or established framework for executive compensation accountability.",

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  hav e  also  receiv ed  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting  transfer  pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate gov ernmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believ e it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\n\n## Note 15.

Google Services generates rev enues primarily from adv ertising; fees receiv ed for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and dev ices.\n- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform serv ices, applications, and other serv ices for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates rev enues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  receiv ed  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  serv ices,  Google  Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise serv ices.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not indiv idually material. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices and internet serv ices.\n\nRevenues,  certain  costs,  such  as  costs  associated  with  content  and  traffic  acquisition,  certain  engineering  activ ities,  and  dev ices,  as  well  as certain  operating  expenses  are  directly  attributable  to  our  segments.

We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker's (CODM ) assessment of segment performance.\n\nThe Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

The Company has entered into payfloating interest rate and cross-currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings to a variable-rate U.S. dollar denominated borrowings indexed to SOFR.\n\n## Cruise Ship Credit Facilities\n\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had two credit facilities to finance, at its option, a significant portion of the contract price of two new cruise ships.

The FTC has sought to expand its authority in this area through various rulemakings related to general privacy, targeted advertising and children's privacy. There has been an increased focus on children's privacy at both the state and federal levels within the United States, as well as internationally. These new laws may require changes to our products and services and could adversely affect our advertising businesses.\n\nIn addition, many international data protection laws, some federal laws, and all 50 U.S. states have security breach notification requirements that obligate businesses to provide notice to consumers and government agencies if certain information has been accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party; some of these laws also require documented information security programs.\n\n## State and Local Taxes\n\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, our businesses, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our businesses, most notably new taxes or fees on digital advertising or other digital commerce. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state and local tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act ('ITFA') prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges and discriminating against electronic commerce; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA or other federal laws.\n\n## Other Regulations\n\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities, actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Studios and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, regulatory fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising,  political  broadcasting,  sponsorship  identification,  Emergency Alert  System,  equal  employment  opportunity  and  other  employment-related  practices, environmental-related matters, our equipment supply chain, and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming, and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in fines, sanctions and/or ongoing compliance plans and government oversight.\n\n## Human Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 182,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Approximately 30% of our employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, East Asia and South Asia. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized, although many of Content &amp; Experiences' freelance and temporary writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements or work councils. Outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\n\nOur company has been built on a foundation of respect, integrity and trust, and we are committed to creating and fostering a work environment that promotes those values. As a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees, and media talent and production employees. Some of our key workforce-related programs and initiatives include the following.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\n- We seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys, as well as through employee resource groups.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cumulative translation losses, net of tax, of $2.66 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively.\n\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Credit Risk and Concentration\n\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.\n\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated 36%, 37%, and 40% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, India and Canada.\n\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nBeginning  in  2024  annual  reporting,  we  adopted Accounting  Standards  Update  (ASU)  No.  2023-07, Segment  Reporting  (Topic  280):  Improvements  to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) that was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This new standard requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. Upon adoption, the guidance was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, which resulted in the disclosure of employee compensation costs for each reportable segment. For additional information, see Note 16 Segment and Geographical Information.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This new standard will be effective for the annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. The new standard permits early adoption and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn  November  2024,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2024-03, Income  Statement-Reporting  Comprehensive  Income-Expense  Disaggregation  Disclosures (Subtopic  220-40):  Disaggregation  of  Income  Statement  Expenses (ASU 2024-03). The new guidance requires disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2027 and for interim  periods  thereafter.  The  new  standard  permits  early  adoption  and  can  be  applied  prospectively  or  retrospectively.  We  are  evaluating  the  effect  that  this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.",

      "answer": "GOOGL discloses that it indemnifies various parties including advertisers, Google Network partners, and cloud customers against intellectual property infringement claims, with no material claims as of December 31, 2024, though future payments could be significant. META similarly indemnifies parties in the context of IP infringement and other claims, noting that while historical payments have not been material, it is currently facing regulatory scrutiny that could lead to significant liabilities. NFLX outlines indemnification obligations tied to IP infringement in content licensing and distribution agreements, but notes no accrual in financial statements due to the conditional nature of these obligations. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies use indemnification clauses as a contractual tool, GOOGL and META face more explicit regulatory and litigation risks that could trigger these clauses, whereas NFLX's exposure appears more contingent and less monetized at this point.",

We hav e agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Sev eral of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we hav e entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\n\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances inv olv ed in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we hav e made under such agreements hav e not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. Howev er, to the extent that v alid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could hav e a material adv erse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not hav e any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nWe record  a  liability  when  we  believ e  that  it  is  probable  that  a  loss  has  been  incurred,  and  the  amount  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  If  we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We ev aluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been prev iously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\n\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculativ e, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either indiv idually or in aggregate, hav e a material adv erse effect.\n\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Antitrust Matters\n\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and inv estigations as well as litigation on v arious competition matters by regulatory authorities and priv ate parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following:\n\n- Shopping: I n  J une  2017,  the  EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its display and ranking of shopping search  results  and  ads  infringed  European  antitrust  laws  and  imposed  a  \u20ac2.4  billion  fine.

We are also responding to regulatory inquiries and litigation related to allegedly deceptive advertising, including but not limited to financial scams, in other parts of the world.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) initiated a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise (NORA) process related to its investigation of advertising for financial products and services on our platform, informing us that staff may recommend to the Director of the CFPB that the Bureau take legal action alleging violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, including based on our alleged receipt and use for advertising of financial information from third parties through certain advertising tools as well as our related user disclosures and controls, and provided us with an opportunity to respond. We disagree with the claims staff is considering and believe an enforcement action is unwarranted, and have responded through the NORA process. The result of the NORA process is uncertain at this time, but if the Director authorizes an action against us, the CFPB could file a lawsuit in the near-term and seek financial penalties and equitable relief.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  subject  to  litigation  and  other  proceedings  involving  law  enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in  Brazil, Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters.

Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) incurs programming expenses for third-party content distribution and produces owned and licensed content, with a focus on per-subscriber fee arrangements and individual monetization strategies. Disney (DIS) reports a detailed breakdown of its content investment pipeline, with over $4.3 billion allocated to produced content for 2025, indicating a significant commitment to content creation. Netflix (NFLX) highlights the risks associated with intellectual property protection, noting that unauthorized use or appropriation of its content could diminish brand value and subscriber growth, underscoring its reliance on proprietary content and legal safeguards. Together, these perspectives illustrate CMCSA's distribution-focused model, DIS's content-heavy investment strategy, and NFLX's emphasis on content exclusivity and IP protection.",

      "answer": "Disney uses foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, with a notional amount of $9.9 billion as of September 28, 2024. Google employs foreign exchange forward contracts as net investment hedges to offset foreign currency translation risk from its investment in foreign subsidiaries, with a $660 million impact on cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI as of December 31, 2024. Netflix utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues and content-related transactions, with a $1.9 billion impact on AOCI related to revenue hedges as of December 31, 2024. Collectively, this shows that while all three companies use FX forwards, Disney focuses on operational cash flows with the largest notional exposure, Google emphasizes balance sheet translation risk, and Netflix prioritizes revenue and content cost stability.",

Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million.

T he change in v alue recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our inv estment in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur Corporate Treasury inv estment strategy is to achiev e a return that will allow us to preserv e capital and maintain liquidity. We inv est primarily in debt securities, including gov ernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate deriv ativ es. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our inv estments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may hav e their fair market v alue adv ersely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we hav e elected the fair v alue option for which changes in fair v alue are recorded in OI&amp;E. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair v alue option at fair v alue with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the v alue of our inv estment portfolio. T he VaR is the expected loss in fair v alue, for a giv en confidence interv al, for our inv estment portfolio due to adv erse mov ements in interest rates. We use a variance/cov ariance VaR model with 95% confidence interv al.

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax  benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-forsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , included in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fix ed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in ex change rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain ex posures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Cost of Revenues' to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.",

      "answer": "Google (Alphabet) emphasizes that attracting and retaining content providers is critical to its advertising business, particularly for YouTube, where the quality of the advertiser base and the ability to help partners generate revenues from ads are key. Netflix explicitly states that its ability to stream content depends on obtaining rights from third-party content providers, and that rising licensing costs and the risk of studios withholding content due to their own streaming services pose a direct threat to its service offering and cost structure. In contrast, the AT&T (T) filing provides no substantive information about its relationship with content providers, suggesting either a lack of material dependency or insufficient disclosure in the provided evidence. This contrast highlights that while content licensing is a central risk for Netflix and a competitive lever for Google, AT&T\u2019s positioning or exposure to content provider dynamics is either less central or not detailed in the available disclosure.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax  benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\n\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption 'Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies' is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-forsale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , included in accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fix ed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\n\nAccordingly, volatility in ex change rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain ex posures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into 'Cost of Revenues' to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively.

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the ev olv ing nature of our business, our historical rev enue growth rate and historical operating margin may  not  be  indicativ e  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information,  see  T rends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  and  Rev enues  and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  reduce  the  value  of  our  products ,  s ervices ,  and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various ev ents outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, serv ices, and technologies. For example, effectiv e intellectual property protection may not be av ailable in ev ery country in which our products and serv ices are distributed or made av ailable through the Internet. Also, the efforts we hav e taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectiv e. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innov ations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innov ations. Moreov er, we may not hav e adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innov ations that later turn out to be important. T here is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. T he secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitiv e information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitiv e  adv antage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

      "answer": "Disney continues to invest heavily in Hulu, with programming and production costs reaching $7,564 million in 2022, reflecting its strategic commitment to the platform as part of its direct-to-consumer portfolio. Google, through YouTube, competes directly with Hulu in the digital video services space, highlighting the competitive pressure in the streaming market and the importance of content and platform reach. In contrast, AT&T had already exited its Hulu investment in 2019, selling its stake for $1,430 million and recognizing a pre-tax gain of $740 million, signaling a strategic pivot away from streaming content ownership toward infrastructure and connectivity. Together, these positions illustrate divergent strategies: Disney doubling down on content aggregation and direct consumer relationships, Google competing on platform scale and advertising, and AT&T exiting content to focus on core telecommunications and network services.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

(Discovery). The agreement is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which WarnerMedia will be distributed to AT&amp;T's shareholders via a pro rata dividend, an exchange offer, or a combination of both, followed by its combination with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T's shareholders. AT&amp;T will receive approximately $43,000 (subject to working capital and other adjustments) in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&amp;T's shareholders will receive stock representing approximately 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own approximately 29% of the new company.\n\nOn February 1, 2022, we announced that we will structure the distribution as a spin-off rather than an exchange offer. Upon closing of the transaction, each AT&amp;T shareholder will receive, on a tax-free basis, an estimated 0.24 shares of the new company for each share of AT&amp;T common stock held as of the record date for the pro rata distribution. The exact number of shares to be received by AT&amp;T shareholders for each AT&amp;T common share will be determined closer to the closing based on the number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock outstanding and the number of shares of Discovery common stock outstanding on an as-converted and as-exercised basis. AT&amp;T shareholders will continue to hold the same number of shares of AT&amp;T common stock after the transaction closes.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&amp;T shareholders. Upon close of the transaction, WarnerMedia will be deconsolidated.\n\nThe merger agreement contains certain customary termination rights for AT&amp;T and Discovery, including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate if the transaction is not completed on or before July 15, 2023. Termination fees under specified circumstances will require Discovery to pay AT&amp;T $720 or AT&amp;T to pay Discovery $1,770.\n\nMagallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, entered into a $41,500 commitment letter (Bridge Loan) on May 17, 2021. On June 4, 2021, Spinco entered into a $10,000 term loan credit agreement (Spinco Term Loan) and reduced the aggregate commitment amount under the Bridge Loan to $31,500. There have been no draws on the Bridge Loan or the Spinco Term Loan. In the event advances are made under the Bridge Loan or Spinco Term Loan, those advances will be used by Spinco to finance a portion of the cash distribution to AT&amp;T in connection with the transaction.\n\nXandr On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr, primarily representing the AppNexus business, to Microsoft, which is expected to close in 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. This advertising business is included in our WarnerMedia segment and is excluded from the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. We applied held-for-sale accounting treatment to the related assets and liabilities of this business, resulting in approximately $550 of goodwill and other intangible assets being reclassified to 'Prepaid and other current assets' as of December 31, 2021.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Netflix each characterize their financial and strategic dependencies on content providers, and what does this reveal about their respective risks and positioning in the streaming and digital media market?",
      "answer": "Disney emphasizes its partnerships with content providers as a core element of its strategy, indicating a collaborative approach that likely supports its content portfolio and distribution reach. Google highlights the importance of its brand strength in attracting content providers but also flags reputational and regulatory risks tied to third-party content on its platforms, suggesting a dependency that is more indirect but still critical to maintaining ecosystem engagement. Netflix explicitly states that its business 'depends on' licensing agreements with studios and content providers, noting that the variability in license terms poses a direct operational and content availability risk. Together, these perspectives reveal differing degrees of dependency and risk exposure: Disney\u2019s is strategic and partnership-based, Google\u2019s is brand-mediated and ecosystem-driven, and Netflix\u2019s is contractual and operationally essential. Financially, this implies that Netflix faces the most immediate risk from content licensing volatility, while Google must manage brand and regulatory exposure, and Disney leverages partnerships for broader market penetration.",

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the ev olv ing nature of our business, our historical rev enue growth rate and historical operating margin may  not  be  indicativ e  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information,  see  T rends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  and  Rev enues  and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  reduce  the  value  of  our  products ,  s ervices ,  and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various ev ents outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, serv ices, and technologies. For example, effectiv e intellectual property protection may not be av ailable in ev ery country in which our products and serv ices are distributed or made av ailable through the Internet. Also, the efforts we hav e taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectiv e. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innov ations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innov ations. Moreov er, we may not hav e adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innov ations that later turn out to be important. T here is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. T he secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitiv e information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitiv e  adv antage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

AT&T (T), however, referenced its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97 in its 2023 Form 10-K filing, suggesting it had already implemented such a policy prior to 2024. These differences indicate that while all three companies operate under similar accounting and regulatory expectations, GOOGL and NFLX formalized or updated their Clawback Policies in early 2024, whereas AT&T had an established framework in place before the reporting year.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content, as well as with other television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations  with  independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed  attractions.  There  is  increased  competition  in  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  theme  parks  and  other  attractions  operated  by  several  companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic G ames and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic G ames. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively.  International  advertising  revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film's ex hibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\n\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\n\nWe generate revenues by deliv ering relev ant, cost-effectiv e online adv ertising; cloud-based solutions that prov ide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform serv ices, and applications; sales of other products and serv ices, such as fees receiv ed for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and dev ices.\n\n## Basis of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the v ariable interest and v oting models. Intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  and  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  and  the  accompanying  notes. Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  these  estimates  due  to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we ev aluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair v alues of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inv entory; and useful liv es of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believ ed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v alues of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or serv ices is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or serv ices is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from rev enues.\n\n## Advertising Revenues\n\nWe generate advertising rev enues primarily by deliv ering adv ertising on:\n\n- Google  Search  and  other  properties,  including  rev enues  from  traffic  generated  by  search  distribution  partners  who  use  Google.com  as  their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube properties; and\n- Google Network properties, including rev enues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\n\nOur  customers  generally  purchase  adv ertising  inv entory  through  Google Ads,  Google Ad  Manager,  Google  Display  &amp;  Video  360,  and  Google Marketing Platform, among others.\n\nWe offer adv ertising by deliv ering both performance and brand adv ertising. We recognize rev enues for performance adv ertising when a user engages with the adv ertisement. For brand adv ertising, we recognize rev enues when the ad is displayed, or a user v iews the ad.\n\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we ev aluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report rev enues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report rev enues on a net basis). Generally, we report adv ertising rev enues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as rev enues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of rev enues. Where we are the principal,  we  control  the  adv ertising  inv entory  before  it  is  transferred  to  our  customers.  Our  control  is  ev idenced  by  our  sole  ability  to  monetize  the advertising inv entory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and hav ing a lev el of discretion in establishing pricing.\n\n## Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\n\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and dev ices rev enues consist of rev enues from:",

      "answer": "Disney highlights that evolving intellectual property (IP) laws, particularly regarding AI-generated content, pose a significant risk due to unauthorized use of its IP and weak enforcement globally, which could reduce revenues. Google emphasizes its reliance on IP laws to protect its proprietary technology and brand, noting that evolving legal frameworks, especially around AI, could increase costs and affect its competitive position. Netflix specifically mentions foreign IP laws, such as the EU copyright directive, as a potential impact on the economics of content creation and distribution, especially in international markets.

      "answer": "As of their most recent fiscal year-ends, DIS does not disclose specific unrealized losses on government bonds, but it emphasizes prudent asset management and diversification strategies to manage financial risk within its master trust. GOOGL reported $679 million in unrealized losses on government bonds as of December 31, 2023, with $13.897 billion in long-term holdings. META reported $217 million in unrealized losses on U.S. government securities as of December 31, 2024, with $4.33 billion in long-term holdings. This suggests that GOOGL has a significantly larger exposure to government bonds compared to META, while DIS focuses more on risk management through diversified investments rather than disclosing specific bond losses.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe primary investment objective for the assets within the master trust is the prudent and cost effective management of assets to satisfy benefit obligations to plan participants. Financial risks are managed through diversification of plan assets, selection of investment managers and through the investment guidelines incorporated in investment management agreements. Investments are monitored to assess whether returns are commensurate with risks taken.\n\nThe long-term asset allocation policy for the master trust was established taking into consideration a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the average age of participants, the number of retirees, the duration of liabilities and the ex pected payout ratio. Liquidity needs of the master trust are generally managed using cash generated by investments or by liquidating securities.\n\nAssets are generally managed by external investment managers pursuant to investment management agreements that establish permitted securities and risk controls commensurate with the account's investment strategy. Some agreements permit the use of derivative securities (futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) that enable investment managers to enhance returns and manage exposures within their accounts.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\n- Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable\n\nInvestments that are valued using the net asset value (NAV) (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy disclosure. NAV per share is determined based on the fair value using the underlying assets divided by the number of units outstanding.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets reported at fair value. The methodologies used at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are the same.\n\nLevel 1 investments are valued based on reported market prices on the last trading day of the fiscal year. Investments in common and preferred stocks and mutual funds are valued based on the securities' exchange-listed price or a broker's quote in an active market. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on a broker's quote in an active market.\n\nLevel 2 investments in government and federal agency bonds and notes (excluding U.S. Treasury securities), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities are valued using a broker's quote in a non-active market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of reported market information, such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and estimated default rates. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on models that incorporate observable inputs for the underlying securities, such as interest rates or foreign currency ex change rates.",

GOOGL indirectly references content providers through the lens of brand risk, noting that third-party content shared on its platforms can negatively affect its brand perception, which in turn impacts its relationships with users, advertisers, and partners like content providers. NFLX directly depends on content providers, as it licenses distribution rights to content, and emphasizes the importance of these relationships in delivering its service to members. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies rely on content providers, the nature and strategic framing of that dependency differ significantly\u2014ranging from operational necessity (CMCSA), reputational exposure (GOOGL), to core service delivery (NFLX).",

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the ev olv ing nature of our business, our historical rev enue growth rate and historical operating margin may  not  be  indicativ e  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information,  see  T rends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  and  Rev enues  and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  reduce  the  value  of  our  products ,  s ervices ,  and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various ev ents outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, serv ices, and technologies. For example, effectiv e intellectual property protection may not be av ailable in ev ery country in which our products and serv ices are distributed or made av ailable through the Internet. Also, the efforts we hav e taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectiv e. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innov ations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innov ations. Moreov er, we may not hav e adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innov ations that later turn out to be important. T here is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. T he secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitiv e information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitiv e  adv antage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

GOOGL reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill), for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. It tests these assets by comparing carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. VZ conducts impairment testing on its wireless licenses and other long-lived intangible assets, using a combination of qualitative and mandatory quantitative assessments every three years. It utilizes the Greenfield approach to estimate fair value and compares it to carrying value to determine impairment.

      "question": "How do Disney, Netflix, and AT&T differ in their use of foreign exchange forward contracts to manage currency risk, particularly in terms of hedging strategies, notional amounts, and the financial impact on earnings and other comprehensive income?",
      "answer": "Disney, Netflix, and AT&T all use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage currency risk, but they differ in their hedging strategies, the notional amounts involved, and the financial impact on earnings and other comprehensive income (AOCI). Disney primarily designates these contracts as cash flow hedges for firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, with notional amounts of $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains and losses are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur. Netflix also uses cash flow hedges for forecasted foreign currency revenues and content-related expenses, with significant exposure to the euro, British pound, and Brazilian real. It reported a potential $958 million adverse change in AOCI if the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, indicating a large notional exposure. AT&T, on the other hand, uses foreign exchange contracts primarily as fair value hedges to manage foreign currency risk on foreign-denominated debt, with unrealized gains or losses directly impacting the value of hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. Unlike Disney and Netflix, AT&T's approach focuses more on balance sheet items rather than revenue or operating expense volatility.",

      "answer": "Disney projects increasing content spending with $4,306 million in 2025, primarily monetized as part of bundled offerings, indicating a strategic focus on driving value through integrated platforms. Netflix reports a $1,104 million increase in content amortization costs in 2024, highlighting its heavy investment in original and exclusive content to drive subscriber growth. Verizon has committed $16.7 billion in unconditional purchase obligations for content and related services, with $6.2 billion allocated for 2025, underscoring its infrastructure-driven approach to content delivery. Together, these figures reflect Disney's bundling strategy, Netflix's content-first model, and Verizon's network and service-based commitment to supporting content consumption.",

From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, V erizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPA s) with third parties. Each of the REPA s is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of 12 to 20 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Nineteen of the facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPA s generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities.\n\nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $16.7 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $6.2 billion is attributable to 2025, $5.5 billion is attributable to 2026, $3.1 billion is attributable to 2027, $1.3 billion is attributable to 2028, $291 million is attributable to 2029 and $363 million is attributable to years thereafter.  These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged.  Since  the  commitments  to  purchase  programming  services  from  television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2024, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.\n\n## Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange A ct of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this A nnual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effectiv e internal control established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is ongoing and is expected to continue over the next few years.\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. A s such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThere were no changes in V erizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control ov er financial reporting.",

In the ordinary course of our business, there are constant attempts by unauthorized parties to cause systems-related events and security incidents and to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design. These incidents include computer hacking, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, malicious social engineering, theft, misconduct, fraud and other malicious activities. Incidents can be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns, human error, software or hardware failures or vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design.\n\nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. For example, we expect threat actors will continue to gain sophistication by using tools and techniques, such as AI, that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks,  information  systems  and  other  technologies  across  the  world  and  create  latent  vulnerabilities  in  our  and  third-party  vendors'  systems  and  other technologies. We also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, that in many cases is provided or made available to third-party vendors who agree to protect it, which has in the past, and may in the future, become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information by us or a third party. Due to the nature of our businesses, we may be at a disproportionately heightened risk of these types of incidents occurring because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form.  We also incorporate third-party software (including extensive open-source software), applications, and data hosting and cloud-based services into many aspects of our products, services and operations, as well as rely on service providers to help us perform our business operations, all of which expose us to cyber attacks  with  respect  to  such  third-party  suppliers  and  service  providers  and  their  products  and  services.  Due  to  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity breaches or incidents experienced by such third parties in relation to the information we share with them. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and those of our third-party vendors, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\n\nWhile we develop and maintain systems, and operate programs that seek to prevent security incidents from occurring, these efforts are costly and must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections. The occurrence of both intentional and unintentional incidents has caused, and may from time to time in the future cause, a variety of business impacts. These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security  of  our  internal  systems,  products,  services  or  satellite  transmission  signals,  power  outages,  and  the  compromise  or  ex filtration  of  sensitive,  personal, proprietary, confidential or technical business information and customer or vendor data, and reputational impacts. In addition, despite efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, attacks can persist for an ex tended period of time before being detected, and following detection, it may take considerable time to understand the nature, scope, impact and timing of the incident. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. Repercussions of these incidents,  some  of  which  we  have  ex perienced  in  the  past,  could  include  litigation  or  cause  regulators  to  impose  significant  fines  or  other  remedial  measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.

As copyrights expire, we expect that revenues generated from such IP will be negatively impacted to some extent.\n\nThe unauthorized use of our IP may increase the cost of protecting rights in our IP or reduce our revenues. The convergence of computing, communications and entertainment devices, increased broadband internet speed and penetration, increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission and increasingly sophisticated attempts to obtain unauthorized access to data systems have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and protection and the enforcement of IP rights more challenging. The unauthorized distribution and access to entertainment content generally continues to be a significant challenge for IP rights holders. Further, the availability of certain AI tools has facilitated the creation of infringing works based on the unauthorized use of our IP. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect entertainment industry IP in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company's operations worldwide, despite the Company's efforts to protect its IP rights. Distribution innovations have increased opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways. Additionally, negative economic conditions coupled with a shift in government priorities could lead to less enforcement. These developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our IP against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content and other commercial misuses of our IP. The legal landscape for some new technologies, including some AI tools, remains uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses.\n\nWith respect to IP developed by the Company and rights acquired by the Company from others, the Company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. In addition, the availability of copyright protection and other legal protections for IP generated by certain new technologies, such as generative AI, is uncertain. Successful challenges to our rights in IP typically result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from or utilize the IP that is the subject of challenged rights. From time to time, third parties allege that the Company is infringing certain third-party IP rights. Technological changes in industries in which the Company operates and extensive patent coverage in those areas increase the risk of such claims being brought and prevailing.\n\n## Cybersecurity and other data compromises and/or attempted compromises increase our costs, disrupt our services and business plans, lead to the disclosure of our confidential information, including unauthorized use of our intellectual property, and negatively impact our reputation.\n\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. We also use computer and cloud-based systems to deliver our products and services and operate our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of unauthorized access, modification, ex filtration, destruction or denial of access and our systems are subject to cyberattacks that from time to time result in disruptions in service. We also use many third-party systems and software, which are also subject to supply chain and other cyberattacks.\n\nWe have developed and maintain an information security program to assess, identify and manage cyber risks and the continued development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, including as a result of the proliferation of AI tools, and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We face an increasingly challenging cybersecurity environment with expanding and evolving threats from a variety of potential bad actors. While we employ various tools in an effort to protect our data and systems, certain of our defenses remain subject to human error. Remote work by our employees and contractors and those of the third parties with whom we engage create additional risks. Despite our efforts, the risk of a potentially material incident as a result of unauthorized access, modification, ex filtration, destruction or denial of access with respect to data or systems and other cybersecurity attacks cannot be eliminated, and from time to time our systems have been compromised and may in the future be compromised. For example, as previously disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, in fiscal 2024 over a terabyte of data from one of the communications systems used by the Company was improperly exfiltrated and released. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in certain cases, which information and related systems have been compromised and are also subject to the risk of future material compromise.\n\nIf our information or cyber security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. We have experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity attacks that result in the misappropriation of personal information of our customers and/or employees, which may result in reputational damage, loss of business and/or harm to employee morale. Related remediation of harm to our customers and employees or damages arising from litigation and/or fines or other actions we take with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of an incident create additional costs and/or impacts to our businesses. Insurance does not cover all potential losses or damages associated with such attacks or events. Our systems and users and those of third parties with whom we engage are continually attacked, sometimes successfully, and there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results.",

As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are based on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\n\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. V iolating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\n\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\n\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by user location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\n\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates.

      "question": "How did the recovery of theatrical releases in 2021 impact the financial performance of CMCSA, DIS, and T, and what does this reveal about their respective sensitivities to box office activity?",
      "answer": "CMCSA reported increased advertising, marketing, and promotion expenses in 2021 due to higher spending on theatrical film releases compared to the prior year, reflecting a rebound in box office activity. DIS noted that theater-going remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, which created uncertainty around the recovery of theatrical releases and affected its broader entertainment revenue model. T highlighted a significant rebound in theatrical performance, with 17 worldwide theatrical releases in 2021 compared to only five in 2020, contributing to higher content and other revenues. This comparative analysis shows that all three companies experienced a resurgence in theatrical activity in 2021, but with differing financial implications: CMCSA faced higher marketing costs, DIS remained cautious about sustained recovery, and T benefited directly from the increased number of theatrical releases.",

The current decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products or subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC products, while also increasing the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation in the domestic and global energy sector and other pronounced price increases generally and in certain other sectors, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. A decline in economic conditions could impact implementation of our business plans, such as our plans to realign our cost structure and for the new DTC ad-supported service, pricing structure and price increases. In addition, actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. Further, global economic conditions may impact foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar has adversely impacted the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and may reduce international demand for our products and services. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar may increase our labor, supply or other costs in non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution may further exacerbate current inflationary pressures and impact our ability to sell and deliver goods or otherwise disrupt our operations. The adverse impact on our businesses of the decline in economic conditions will depend, in part, on its severity and duration and our ability to mitigate the impacts of this decline on our businesses will be limited.\n\n## Changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.\n\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. This trend has impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels, including for a number of our networks. In addition, theater-going to watch movies currently is, and may continue to be, below pre-COVID-19 levels. Declines in linear viewership have resulted in decreased advertising revenue. In order to respond to these developments, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement changes to our business models, most recently by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, initiating plans to again reorganize our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies, and developing next generation storytelling offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, next generation storytelling offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to these changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution may increase the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. We expect to forgo revenue from traditional sources, particularly as we expand our DTC offerings. To date we have experienced significant losses in our DTC businesses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will ultimately be profitable or as profitable as our existing or historic business models.\n\n## Misalignment with public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment, travel and consumer products could negatively impact demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.\n\nOur businesses create entertainment, travel and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create compelling content, which may be distributed, among other ways, through broadcast, cable, internet or cellular technology, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products. Such distribution must meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. The success of our theme parks, resorts, cruise ships and experiences, as well as our theatrical releases, depends on demand for public or out-of-home",

The increase in 2021 was due to higher TV production and licensing, which represent a partial recovery from prior-year impacts of the pandemic, as well as higher theatrical, with 2020 including only five worldwide theatrical releases compared to 17 in 2021. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemicrelated movie theater closures and television and theatrical production delays.\n\nAdvertising revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was due to the return in 2021 of major sporting events, including the NCAA Division I Men's Championship Basketball Tournament. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the pandemic-related cancellation of sporting events, partially offset by higher news coverage of general elections and COVID-19 developments.\n\nDirect costs increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was driven by higher film and programming costs and increased costs for HBO Max. Direct costs supporting DTC revenues were $7,934 in 2021, versus $5,452 and $3,824 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemic-related closures and production delays.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental selling costs associated with a DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing arrangement, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and integration of support functions. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower print and advertising expenses from limited theatrical releases, lower distribution fees and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by marketing costs associated with HBO Max.\n\nOperating contribution decreased in 2021 and 2020. The WarnerMedia segment operating income margin was 20.3% in 2021, 26.9% in 2020 and 29.8% in 2019.\n\n## LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT\n\n",

For ex ample, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the  United  States  and  internationally,  we  have  filed  various  applications  for  protection  of  certain  aspects  of  our  intellectual  property,  and  we  currently  hold  a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that  are  substantially  similar  to  ours  and  compete  with  our  business.  In  addition,  we  regularly  contribute  software  source  code  under  open  source  and  other permissive  licenses  and  have  made  other  technology  we  developed  available  under  such  licenses,  and  we  include  open  source  software  in  our  products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to open source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation  based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights.  In addition, various \"non-practicing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to ex tract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, or introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and other rights holders.\n\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, trademarks,  or  user  content,  infringe  their  intellectual  property  rights.  We  presently  are  involved  in  a  number  of  intellectual  property  lawsuits,  and  as  we  face increasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual property litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us",

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party 'cloud' computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party",

      "answer": "CMCSA issued 9,444,375 shares of Class B common stock in 2023, which is distinct from its Class A common stock that carries different voting rights. GOOGL's Class B common stock provides 10 votes per share, compared to 1 vote per share for Class A, and can convert to Class A shares upon sale or transfer, while its Class C capital stock has no voting rights. META disclosed that its Class B common stock is not publicly traded, and holders of both Class A and Class B common stock are eligible for the same dividend terms, as seen with its $0.50 per share dividend initiation in 2024. These differences in stock structures reveal distinct governance strategies: CMCSA focuses on capital structure transparency, GOOGL emphasizes founder control through weighted voting rights, and META prioritizes alignment of interests between shareholders through equal dividend treatment.",

      "question": "How do Disney (DIS), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Netflix (NFLX) each disclose the implementation timeline and governance structure of their Clawback Policies in their 2024 10-K filings, and what does this reveal about their approach to executive compensation accountability?",
      "answer": "Disney filed its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97 in its 2024 10-K, indicating it was formally adopted and documented alongside its financial reporting. Alphabet introduced its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97.01 in its 10-K on January 31, 2024, suggesting a recent formalization aligned with its broader executive compensation plans. Netflix disclosed its Clawback Policy as Exhibit 97.1, incorporated by reference in its 10-K and dated January 26, 2024, showing a similar recent adoption timeline. While all three companies have now formalized clawback mechanisms, Disney's inclusion in the filing list suggests longer-standing governance, whereas Alphabet and Netflix appear to have introduced their policies in early 2024, possibly in response to evolving regulatory or investor expectations around executive accountability.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA's content production costs, NFLX's intellectual property risks, and VZ's content purchase obligations reflect their respective financial exposures and strategic approaches to content in the 2023 communication services sector?",
      "answer": "CMCSA incurs programming and content production costs through multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers and per-subscriber rates. These costs are recognized based on agreement rates and are not subject to impairment, indicating a stable, long-term investment in content. NFLX faces significant risks related to intellectual property, where inadequate protection of proprietary rights could diminish the value of its brand and content, directly impacting its ability to attract and retain members. The company also faces potential costly litigation and operational adjustments due to third-party infringement claims, highlighting the vulnerability of its content-centric business model. VZ has substantial unconditional purchase obligations, with a significant portion tied to content commitments. The company estimates $21.7 billion in future purchase obligations, including content, with $8.9 billion attributable to 2024 alone. This reflects a strategic commitment to content as a key component of its offerings. While CMCSA focuses on stable content acquisition, NFLX grapples with protecting its content, and VZ commits heavily to content purchases, each revealing distinct financial and strategic exposures.",

      "answer": "CMCSA identifies social networking platforms and user-generated content as key competitors in the advertising market, noting that these platforms contribute to audience fragmentation and declining ad revenue. DIS similarly highlights competition from social media platforms for viewer attention and advertising dollars, particularly in its Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer segments. GOOGL explicitly lists social networks as competitors, emphasizing that users may rely on them for product referrals instead of traditional search engines, directly impacting its advertising business. Together, these perspectives show that all three companies view social platforms like Facebook as significant disruptors in digital advertising and content consumption, though each emphasizes different aspects of the threat based on their core business models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content, as well as with other television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations  with  independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed  attractions.  There  is  increased  competition  in  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  theme  parks  and  other  attractions  operated  by  several  companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic G ames and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic G ames. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively.  International  advertising  revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film's ex hibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\n\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

Now , Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, v isualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solv e big problems that affect a wide v ariety of industries, including transportation and health technology. Alphabet's inv estment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at v arious stages of dev elopment, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriv ing, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside inv estors. While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating rev enue and making important strides in their industries. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptiv e technologies. We face formidable competition in ev ery aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:\n\n- general purpose search engines and information serv ices;\n- vertical  search  engines  and  e-commerce  prov iders  for  queries  on  topics  such  as  those  related  to  trav el,  jobs,  and  health,  which  users  may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n- online adv ertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming serv ices;\n- other forms of adv ertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and telev ision as our adv ertisers typically adv ertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n- digital content and application platform prov iders;\n- prov iders of enterprise cloud serv ices;\n- developers and prov iders of AI products and serv ices;\n- companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that hav e dev eloped proprietary platforms;\n- prov iders of digital v ideo serv ices;\n- social networks, which users may rely on for product or serv ice referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;\n- prov iders of workspace communication and connectiv ity products; and\n- digital assistant prov iders.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heav ily on our ability to dev elop and distribute innov ativ e products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for adv ertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and serv ices are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relev ance of our adv ertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and av ailability of our products and serv ices;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliv er their adv ertisements in an efficient and effectiv e manner across a v ariety of distribution channels; and\n- content prov iders, primarily based on the quality of our adv ertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate rev enues from adv ertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.",

      "answer": "Google emphasizes its dependence on unrestricted and high-quality Internet access for its platforms, noting that any degradation or increased cost of access could lead to loss of users and advertisers. Netflix similarly depends on reliable and affordable Internet access for streaming, and warns that bandwidth caps or preferential treatment by network operators could increase costs and hinder member acquisition. In contrast, Verizon actively sells Internet access through wireless, fixed, and FWA (Fixed Wireless Access) services, reporting 3.1 million FWA broadband connections as of December 31, 2023, positioning itself as a key infrastructure provider rather than a dependent entity.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and VZ each address the regulatory burden and compliance costs associated with varying privacy and data protection laws across jurisdictions, and what specific challenges do they highlight in adapting their operations to these requirements?",
      "answer": "CMCSA notes that privacy and data protection laws impose restrictions on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, with state-level laws expanding consumer rights such as access, deletion, and opt-in requirements for sensitive data. Internationally, laws similar to the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act 2018 further complicate compliance. DIS emphasizes that privacy and data protection laws are a key component of regulatory costs and constraints, particularly in the U.S. and internationally, and that evolving regulations\u2014especially around children's privacy\u2014require changes to products and services, adversely affecting advertising businesses. VZ highlights that privacy and data protection laws such as the CCPA and GDPR impose significant penalties for non-compliance, and that increasing global attention to privacy is leading to more legislation, which could significantly impact its business operations. Together, these companies face a complex and evolving regulatory landscape that requires ongoing adaptation, with specific emphasis on consumer rights, children\u2019s data, and international harmonization challenges.",

      "question": "What can we infer about the debt structuring approaches of Comcast, Meta, and Verizon based on how each company references the Second Supplemental Indenture in their filings?",
      "answer": "Comcast (CMCSA) references the Second Supplemental Indenture dated August 31, 2009, under the trustee relationship with The Bank of New York Mellon, indicating a long-standing and evolving debt framework tied to an older base indenture from 2003. Meta (META) executed its Second Supplemental Indenture on May 3, 2023, with U.S. Bank Trust Company, suggesting a more recent and potentially strategic update to its debt structure, building on a base indenture from August 2022. Verizon (VZ) filed its Second Supplemental Indenture on September 29, 2004, with U.S. Bank National Association (successor to Wachovia Bank), showing an earlier but still active engagement with this legal framework. The differences in timing and trustee relationships suggest varying approaches: Comcast's layered, long-term debt structure, Meta's agile and recent update, and Verizon's established but still active use of supplemental indentures.",

      "answer": "Disney quantifies its future content spending commitments, projecting $4,306 million in total produced content costs for 2025, indicating a structured investment approach tied to release schedules. Netflix highlights the vulnerability of its content library to intellectual property risks, noting that inadequate protection could diminish the value of its brand and content, and expose it to costly litigation or service disruptions. Verizon, while not a content creator, discloses a $21.7 billion obligation for content purchases as part of its broader network and service commitments, underscoring its dependency on third-party content availability and pricing. Together, these perspectives illustrate how content drives financial exposure and operational risk across different business models: Disney through production investment, Netflix through IP vulnerability, and Verizon through contractual dependency.",

      "answer": "GOOGL uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge both monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted earnings, and estimates that a 10% adverse exchange rate change could have resulted in a $503 million and $135 million impact on income before taxes as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. META primarily hedges revenue risk in Euros and reports transaction losses of $690 million in 2024, indicating a more reactive or limited hedging approach compared to GOOGL. T manages foreign exchange risk through cross-currency swaps on its foreign-denominated debt, with $34,884 million in notional value outstanding as of December 31, 2024, focusing on long-term debt rather than operational cash flows. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies face foreign exchange risk, GOOGL takes a comprehensive hedging approach across both assets and earnings, META appears to have less aggressive hedging with notable realized losses, and T focuses on hedging debt rather than operational exposure.",

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes.\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nWe  are  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  and  gov ernment  inquiries  and  inv estigations,  other  proceedings,  and  consent  orders  inv olv ing competition, intellectual property, data priv acy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by  our  users,  goods  and  serv ices  offered  by  adv ertisers  or  publishers  using  our  platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters. Certain of these matters include speculativ e claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believ e that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, dev elopments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been prev iously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity inv estment risks.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International rev enues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. As discussed below , we enter into deriv ativ e instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adv erse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\n\nWe  use  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  to  offset  the  foreign  exchange  risk  on  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign  currency  exchange  rate  mov ements  on  our  assets  and  liabilities.  T he  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  on  these  assets  and  liabilities  are recorded in OI&amp;E, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\n\nIf  an  adv erse  10%  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  net  monetary  assets,  liabilities,  and  commitments  denominated  in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would hav e resulted in an adv erse effect on income before income taxes of approximately  $503  million and  $135  million  as  of December  31,  2023  and  2024,  respectiv ely,  after  consideration  of  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equiv alent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts  offset  the  foreign  currency  gains  related  to  our  earnings.  T hese  hedging  contracts  reduce,  but  do  not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate mov ements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect  the  gains  and  losses  of  foreign  currency  spot  rate  changes  as  a  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensiv e  income  (AOCI)  and subsequently reclassify them into rev enues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges before tax effect would hav e been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the  U.S. dollar, primarily the  Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other  operating  results  as  ex pressed  in  U.S.  dollars.  See  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  -  Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $690 million, $366 million, and $81 million were recognized in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.\n\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $680 million and $355 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2024  and  2023,  we  also  had  aggregate  principal  amounts  of  fix ed-rate  senior  notes  (the  Notes)  outstanding  of  $29.0  billion  and $18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fix ed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the fair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privatelyheld companies without readily determinable fair values.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. It is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign ex change ex posure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flex ibility over the long term. In managing market risks, we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures, including interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign currency ex change contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future.\n\nOne of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weighted-average discount rate, which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fix ed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. In recent years, the discount rates have been increasingly volatile, and on average have been lower than in historical periods. Lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations. Future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations, improved funded status and actuarial gains.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe majority of our financial instruments are medium- and long-term fixed-rate notes and debentures. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments. The principal amounts by expected maturity, average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are ex posed to interest rate risk are described in Notes 11 and 12. In managing interest expense, we control our mix of fix ed- and floating-rate debt through term loans, floating- rate notes, and interest rate swaps. We have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios.\n\nOur foreign-denominated long-term debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance through crosscurrency swaps, removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. Likewise, periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fix edrate debt. We expect gains or losses on our cross-currency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge.\n\nWe had no interest rate swaps and no interest rate locks at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nWe principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge costs and debt denominated in foreign currencies. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies.\n\nThrough cross-currency swaps, our foreign-denominated debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance, removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. We expect gains or losses in our cross-currency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge. We had cross-currency swaps with a notional value of $34,884 and a fair value of $(4,076) outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing specific risks, we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk ex posures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations. We had no foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2024.",

Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows  or  platforms,  such  as  U.S.  and  international  syndication,  home  entertainment,  and  other  distribution  platforms,  are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\n\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and  are  not  subject  to  impairment.  When  performing  an  impairment  assessment,  we  estimate  fair  value  primarily  based  on  a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. Adjustments to capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nWe maintain a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and we are exposed to the market risk of adverse changes in interest rates. In order to manage the cost and volatility relating to the interest cost of our outstanding debt, we enter into various interest rate risk management derivative transactions in accordance with our policy.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to the risk of adverse changes in interest rates through the use of techniques that include market valuation and sensitivity analyses. We do not engage in any speculative or leveraged derivative transactions.\n\nOur interest rate derivative financial instruments, which primarily include cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps, represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program.\n\nThe effect of our interest rate derivative financial instruments to our consolidated interest expense was a decrease of $2 million in 2021, a decrease of $9 million in 2020, and a decrease of $49 million in 2019. Interest rate derivative financial instruments may have a significant effect on consolidated interest expense in the future.\n\nThe table below summarizes by contractual year of maturity the principal amount of our debt, notional amount of our interest rate instruments, effective rates, and fair values subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2021. We estimate interest rates on variable rate debt and swaps using the relevant average implied forward rates through the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect on December 31, 2021, plus the applicable borrowing margin.\n\n",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit            | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

The discount rate has a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and auditing the discount rate was complex because it required an evaluation of the credit quality of the corporate bonds used to develop the discount rate and the correlation of those bonds' cash inflows to the timing and amount of future expected benefit payments. obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls management's review of the determination of the discount rates used in the defined benefit pension and benefit obligations calculations. test the determination of the discount rate used in the calculation of the defined benefit pension and benefit obligations, we performed audit procedures that focused on evaluating, with the                        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | We over postretirement To postretirement assistance of our actuarial specialists, the determination of the discount rates, among other procedures. For example, we evaluated the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rates applied in measuring the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we considered the credit quality of the corporate bonds that comprise the yield curve and compared the timing and amount of cash flows at maturity with the expected amounts and duration of the related benefit payments. Evaluation of goodwill for impairment At December 31, 2021, the Company's goodwill balance was $133,223 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, reporting unit goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Description of the Matter                  | Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves the utilization of discounted cash flow models and market multiples valuation approaches. Auditing management's annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units was complex because the estimation of fair values involves subjective management assumptions, such as estimates of the projected rates of discrete and long-term growth of cash flows and weighted average cost of capital. These assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by shifts in the evolving market landscape.

Our procedures included testing controls over management's review of the valuation models and the significant assumptions described above. Our audit procedures to test management's impairment evaluations included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used to develop such assumptions. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, and other guideline companies in the same industry. Where appropriate, we evaluated whether changes to the Company's business model, customer base and other factors would affect the significant assumptions. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed independent sensitivity analyses.

AT&T, through its investments in 5G infrastructure, emphasizes expanding its network capabilities and customer base, particularly in fixed wireless access (FWA) and IoT, as a driver of future service revenue growth. Verizon explicitly positions 5G as a core growth engine, projecting increased access revenue from mobile and FWA connectivity and highlighting its network quality as a competitive differentiator. Together, these perspectives show Meta focusing on platform interoperability risks, AT&T on infrastructure investment and customer acquisition, and Verizon on monetizing superior network performance.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and GOOGL each manage their exposure to the Japanese Yen, and what do their respective hedging strategies reveal about the scale and nature of their international operations?",
      "answer": "CMCSA acknowledges exposure to Japanese Yen fluctuations due to its international operations and employs foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain risks, though notes these may not fully mitigate exchange rate volatility. DIS actively hedges its exposure to the Japanese Yen through forward and option contracts, with $9.9 billion in notional amounts of foreign exchange cash flow hedges as of 2024, reflecting a structured policy to protect forecasted transactions. GOOGL uses a comprehensive set of foreign currency forwards and options, including collars, to hedge both balance sheet exposures and forecasted earnings in the Japanese Yen, estimating a potential $503 million adverse impact pre-hedging in 2023. The comparative analysis shows that while all three companies hedge against Yen exposure, the scale and sophistication of DIS and GOOGL's strategies suggest more extensive international revenue streams and financial planning compared to CMCSA's more general risk acknowledgment.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, DIS, and T each describe their regulatory obligations under the Communications Act of 1934, and what do these descriptions reveal about the distinct ways each company is impacted by federal communications regulation?",
      "answer": "CMCSA highlights that the Communications Act of 1934 and FCC regulations significantly affect its U.S. communications businesses, particularly in the context of legislative and regulatory changes that could impact its competitive position. DIS emphasizes the FCC's role in regulating its television broadcasting operations, including licensing requirements for owned stations and the potential consequences of non-compliance such as fines or license revocation. T outlines how the Communications Act gives the FCC broad authority over its interstate telecommunications services, particularly wireless spectrum licensing and intercarrier compensation, and expresses a strategic interest in reducing outdated regulatory burdens. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are subject to the same foundational law, the nature and operational implications of that regulation vary significantly across their business models.",

      "question": "How do CMCSA, GOOGL, and NFLX each describe their exposure to international intellectual property laws, and what does this reveal about their respective content monetization strategies and legal risk mitigation approaches?",
      "answer": "CMCSA highlights active enforcement of intellectual property rights and substantial resources spent on protection, noting that modifications to U.S. or international copyright laws could adversely affect its ability to license and sell programming. GOOGL emphasizes reliance on a broad portfolio of registered trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and patents globally, indicating a strategy focused on proactive legal asset building and licensing. NFLX specifically cites foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, as potential disruptors to content economics and distribution, showing a risk-aware approach in international markets. Together, these perspectives reveal CMCSA's focus on enforcement, GOOGL's emphasis on portfolio strength, and NFLX's sensitivity to regulatory shifts in content-heavy jurisdictions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Intellectual Property Laws: Actively enforces IP rights and spends substantial resources to protect content; changes in copyright laws could impact licensing and sales.",
        "Hop 2: GOOGL \u2192 Intellectual Property Laws: Relies on registered trademarks, domain names, copyrights, and patents globally, with a focus on portfolio strength and potential licensing.",
        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Intellectual Property Laws: Notes that foreign IP laws like the EU copyright directive may affect content economics and distribution, indicating regulatory risk in international markets."

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Netflix each describe their strategic relationship with content providers, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to content licensing, competition, and platform differentiation in the streaming and digital media ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Disney describes its strategic shift toward distributing content directly through its DTC streaming services rather than licensing to third parties, reflecting a move to retain control over content monetization. Google emphasizes its need to attract and retain content providers by offering a strong advertiser base and revenue-generating capabilities, positioning itself as a key platform for content distribution. Netflix highlights the growing challenge of securing content from providers who are increasingly launching their own streaming platforms, leading to higher programming costs and a strategic focus on exclusive and original content. Together, these perspectives reveal differing approaches: Disney prioritizes direct-to-consumer control, Google focuses on platform attractiveness to both advertisers and content creators, and Netflix emphasizes content exclusivity and curation to maintain member satisfaction.",

Although COVID-19 continues to impact our theatrical distribution business in certain markets, the impact in fiscal 2021 was more significant due to theater closures and capacity restrictions in many territories in which we operate. Titles released in the current year included Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness , Thor: Love and Thunder , Eternals , Encanto and Lightyear. Titles released in the prior year included ShangChi &amp; The Legend of The Ten Rings , Black Widow and Free Guy .\n\nThe decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to lower unit sales despite the benefit of more new release titles in the current year. Net effective pricing was comparable to the prior year as lower unit pricing was offset by a higher mix of new release titles, which have a higher sales price than catalog titles.\n\nThe increase in other revenue was due to more stage play performances in the current year as productions were generally shut down in the prior year due to COVID-19.\n\nOperating expenses are as follows:\n\n",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, patent infringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If studios, content providers or other rights holders refuse to license streaming content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our membership acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n\nMusic and certain authors' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations ('CMOs') and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g. remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights could expose us to greater distribution expenses.\n\n## If our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to enforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark and patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or held by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or misappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations, the",

Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc. ). On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\n\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102 on the Treaty  of  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  in  relation  to  certain  alleged  business  practices  relating  to  Facebook  Marketplace  and  imposed  a  fine  of approximately EUR \u20ac798 million.

The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary view that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\n\n## Securities and Other Actions\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation ) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit's order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10, 2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices.

We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics.

Also in 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing but did not include terms of future spectrum sharing model(s) or specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government's ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes and on terms suitable for mobile broadband network deployments remains uncertain.\n\n## Increasing competition could materially adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, reliability, speed, coverage area and customer service. In addition, we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and IP-based networks, among others. We expect market saturation to continue, which may cause the wireless industry's customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers, including from strategic alliances in converged connectivity. Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or promotional strategies pursued by competitors. We also expect that our customers' growing demand for high-speed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity. These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Additionally, we may not be able to accurately predict future consumer demands or the success of new services in markets. Our ability to address these issues will depend, among other things, on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services. These efforts will involve significant ex penses and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and service offerings. In addition, a sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings has resulted in the past, and may again result in the future, in a significant negative impact on its fair value, requiring us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\n## Intellectual property rights may be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities, which may materially adversely affect our operations.\n\nWe may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our intellectual property rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could materially adversely impact our operations.\n\n## Incidents or public assertions leading to damage to our reputation or questions about our business conduct, and any resulting lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe believe that our brand image, awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business. Our reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including quality or reliability issues related to our services, products and operations; cybersecurity incidents and data breaches, including our actual or perceived responses thereto; regulatory compliance; governance issues; our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social and other sensitive matters; and the conduct of our employees and former employees. Our ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to an inclusive workplace, ethical business practices and other qualities.\n\nWe currently are, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers' compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, statutory or regulatory claims, negligence or gross negligence, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management's attention from our business. In 2023, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles alleging that lead-clad telecommunications cables are a public-health hazard or may pose environmental risks. We are currently subject to litigation and have received inquiries from government authorities as a result of these assertions. We may be subject to additional litigation, government investigations and potentially new regulation or legislation relating to lead-clad cables. Any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts as a result of any of these issues, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, ability to serve customers, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",

      "answer": "CMCSA emphasizes its investment in original content for Peacock and highlights the risk of content owners bypassing traditional distribution to deliver directly to consumers, which impacts both licensing revenue and content availability. DIS, while not explicitly quantifying its content production investment in the provided evidence, implicitly depends on high-quality, branded content (such as from Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Disney Studios) to drive engagement on its DTC platforms like Disney+. NFLX provides concrete figures, showing a $171 million increase in content amortization and a $376 million rise in content acquisition and production costs, underscoring its aggressive investment strategy in global content creation. Together, these perspectives reveal CMCSA's cautious adaptation, DIS's brand-driven content strategy, and NFLX's high-investment, content-centric model in the evolving DTC streaming landscape.",

As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit (calculated using a combination of a market approach and an income approach) to its carrying amount. As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, an impairment charge of $5.8 billion in the Business reporting unit was recorded during the year. Auditing management's goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the inherent subjectivity of developing an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit, which is based on assumptions about future conditions, transactions, or events whose outcome is uncertain and will therefore be subject to change over time. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process.

      "answer": "CMCSA identifies content providers as a critical dependency in its business, though specific financial details are not disclosed. GOOGL reports paying content providers based on revenue generated or flat fees for YouTube and Google Play content, indicating a flexible monetization model. META discloses that it pays content providers for licensed video and music to boost platform engagement, with costs expensed either per title or over the license period. The synthesis reveals that while all three companies rely on content providers, their monetization strategies and financial commitments vary significantly\u2014GOOGL and META emphasize direct licensing and revenue-sharing, while CMCSA\u2019s relationship appears more foundational and less transparent.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at October 1, 2022 or at October 2, 2021, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes, enabling management to focus on core business issues and challenges.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $7.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $704 million.

These  forward  contracts  reduce,  but  do  not  entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\n\nIf  an  adverse  10%  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  change  was  applied  to  total  monetary  assets,  liabilities,  and commitments denominated in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currencies  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  it  would  have resulted  in  an  adverse  effect  on  income  before  income  taxes  of  approximately  $497  million  and  $285  million  as  of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe  use  foreign  currency  forwards  and  option  contracts,  including  collars  (an  option  strategy  comprised  of  a combination  of  purchased  and  written  options)  to  protect  forecasted  U.S.  dollar-equivalent  earnings  from  changes  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  When  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens,  gains  from  foreign  currency  options  and  forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely  eliminate,  the  effect  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign  exchange  contracts  before  tax  effect  would  have  been  approximately  $912  million  and  $1.3  billion  lower  as  of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\n\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations.\n\nIf  the  U.S.  dollar  weakened  by  10%,  the  amount  recorded  in  cumulative  translation  adjustment  (CTA)  within AOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately $1.0 billion lower as of both December 31, 2020 and 2021. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity.  We invest primarily in debt securities, including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment  portfolio  due  to  adverse  movements  in  interest  rates.  We  use  a  variance/covariance  VaR  model  with  95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 are shown below (in millions):\n\n",

Short-term investments and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in 'Prepaid and other current assets' and our investment securities are recorded in 'Other Assets' on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nWe enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.\n\nFair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount.\n\nWe also designate some of our cross-currency swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For these hedges we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross-currency swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings through the swap accrual over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.\n\nCash Flow Hedging We designate most of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges. We have entered into multiple crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk generated from our foreign-denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign currency denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign currencydenominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\n\nWe also designate some of our foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge certain forecasted film production costs and film tax incentives denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $73 from accumulated OCI to 'Interest expense' due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.",

      "answer": "All three companies\u2014Alphabet, Meta, and Netflix\u2014use the reinvestment of dividends assumption in their 5-year cumulative total return graphs to benchmark their stock performance against major indices. Alphabet's graph compares its Class C stock against the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and RDG Internet Composite, assuming reinvestment of all dividends from December 31, 2018, to December 31, 2023. Meta\u2019s graph similarly compares its Class A stock against the DJINET, S&P 500, and NASDAQ Composite, with reinvestment of gross dividends over the same five-year period. Netflix also uses the same reinvestment assumption in its graph comparing its common stock with the NASDAQ Composite, S&P 500, and RDG Internet Composite, measured from the end of each fiscal year between 2018 and 2023.

      "question": "How do CMCSA, META, and NFLX each assess the impact of privacy regulations on their advertising revenue models, and what does this reveal about their respective exposure to regulatory constraints in the digital media ecosystem?",
      "answer": "CMCSA highlights the cyclical nature of its advertising revenue, particularly around major sporting events like the Super Bowl and Olympics, and notes that privacy regulations could create a patchwork of conflicting state requirements affecting its ability to compete effectively. META acknowledges being subject to extensive privacy-related investigations and enforcement actions, including a modified consent order from the FTC and ongoing scrutiny from EU regulators, which have constrained its data use practices and could limit its ability to innovate or use data from users under 18. NFLX identifies regulatory developments related to privacy and data collection as a key risk factor for its nascent advertising business, noting that changes in third-party policies or privacy laws could negatively impact its ability to measure, deliver, and select ads effectively. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies are impacted by privacy regulations, META faces the most direct enforcement pressure, CMCSA is concerned about regulatory fragmentation, and NFLX is particularly vulnerable as it scales its ad-supported tier.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA \u2192 Privacy Regulations: CMCSA notes that privacy regulations, along with net neutrality rules, could create a 'patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements' that affect its ability to compete effectively.",

        "Hop 3: NFLX \u2192 Privacy Regulations: NFLX identifies 'regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations' as a risk factor for its advertising revenue, particularly around ad targeting and measurement tools."

      "question": "How do Google, Netflix, and Verizon differ in their financial exposure and strategic approaches to intellectual property claims, and what does this reveal about their respective risk management priorities in 2024?",
      "answer": "Google discloses that it faces a broad range of litigation, including intellectual property claims, which could result in adverse consequences such as financial liabilities. The company has internal controls and legal assessments in place, and its auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, has evaluated its disclosures and risk assessments related to these matters. Netflix highlights the growing exposure to intellectual property claims, especially as it adopts emerging technologies like AI, and notes that defending against such claims is costly and could require changes to its business practices, including removing content or products from its service. Verizon, on the other hand, primarily discusses intellectual property from the perspective of being a rights holder, actively licensing its IP for revenue, while also acknowledging that it receives notices of alleged infringement, which could require damages, rebranding, or cessation of services. The comparative analysis shows that Google focuses on broad litigation risk with formal controls, Netflix emphasizes the growing threat from new technologies and the cost of defense, and Verizon centers on monetizing its IP while managing inbound infringement claims. This reveals that Google prioritizes internal governance, Netflix is concerned with scaling risk from innovation, and Verizon balances IP monetization with defensive exposure.",

If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial intelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a thirdparty's systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party 'cloud' computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party",

In order to realize our core business strategy , we have developed human capital programs and practices that support, develop and care for our employees throughout their careers with V erizon. Our strategy to build a workforce with talent, skills and motivation to give the company a competitive edge now and into the future rests on three pillars:\n\n- Attract and maintain a diverse workforce with the necessary skills and talent to execute on our business priorities.\n- Develop our employees' potential by offering educational opportunities that keep pace with changes occurring across our industry.\n- Inspire individuals to build a career at V erizon by providing meaningful work and opportunities for career advancement in a collaborative and inclusive environment.\n\nVerizon strives to be an employer of choice by offering our employees competitive compensation and benefits packages. We seek to recruit and retain employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to best meet the needs of the diverse customers and communities we serve. We provide extensive onthe-job training opportunities, tuition reimbursement programs and career development support to enable our employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally . A s of December 31, 2024, V erizon's global workforce was approximately 68.6% male, 31.1% female and 0.3% unknown or undeclared, and the race/ethnicity of our U.S. workforce was 52.5% White, 18.4% Black, 14.0% Hispanic, 8.8% A sian, 0.4% A merican Indian / A laskan Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander, 2.6% two or more races, and 3.0% unknown or undeclared. Women represented 36.2% of U.S. senior leadership (vice president level and above). People of color represented 34.0% of U.S. senior leadership.\n\nVerizon respects our employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining in compliance with applicable laws, including the right to join or not join labor unions. We have a long history of working with the Communications Workers of A merica and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - the two unions that in total represent approximately 25% of our employees as of December 31, 2024. The current collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees who serve customers in our M id-A tlantic and Northeast service areas extend through A ugust 1, 2026. Other collective bargaining agreements covering smaller groups of employees extend through various dates between 2025 and 2028. In addition, where applicable outside of the U.S., we engage with employee representative bodies such as works council. V erizon meets with U.S. national and local union leaders, as well as works council leaders outside the U.S., to talk about key business topics, including safety , customer service, plans to improve operational processes, our business performance and the impacts that changing technology and competition are having on our customers, employees and business strategy.\n\nFor a discussion of V erizon's Board oversight of risks related to our human capital resources, see the section entitled \"Governance - Our governance framework - Oversight of business risks\" in our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to shareholders in connection with our 2025 Annual M eeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Patents, Trademarks and Licenses\n\nWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of V erizon's brands and the results of V erizon's research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for V erizon, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.\n\nWe periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, rebrand, or cease offering the relevant products or services.\n\n## Information About Our Executive Officers\n\nSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers.",

      "answer": "CMCSA applies the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities by adjusting the investments for observable price changes of identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and records changes in value in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. GOOGL accounts for most of its non-marketable equity securities under the measurement alternative, measuring them at cost, less impairment, plus or minus changes in fair value from observable transactions. META also uses the measurement alternative for substantially all of its non-marketable equity securities, adjusting for observable price changes and performing qualitative assessments for impairment at each reporting date. While all three companies apply the same accounting policy, CMCSA emphasizes observable market inputs (Level 2), GOOGL integrates the fair value option for certain instruments, and META highlights the complexity and risk in valuing its illiquid investments, particularly its $6.14 billion investment in Jio Platforms Limited as of December 31, 2023.",

From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and V erizon will seek to defend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, letters of credit totaling approximately $816 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and support several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, V erizon had 28 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPA s) with third parties. Each of the REPA s is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of 12 to 20 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation. Nineteen of the facilities have entered into commercial operation, and the remainder are under development. The REPA s generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the facilities.\n\nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $16.7 billion, and primarily represent commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers. Of this total amount, $6.2 billion is attributable to 2025, $5.5 billion is attributable to 2026, $3.1 billion is attributable to 2027, $1.3 billion is attributable to 2028, $291 million is attributable to 2029 and $363 million is attributable to years thereafter.  These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on the noncancelable quantities to which we are contractually obliged.  Since  the  commitments  to  purchase  programming  services  from  television networks and broadcast stations have no minimum volume requirement, we estimated our obligation based on number of subscribers at December 31, 2024, and applicable rates stipulated in the contracts in effect at that time. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment.\n\n## Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange A ct of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this A nnual Report, that ensure that information relating to the registrant which is required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods using the criteria for effectiv e internal control established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial systems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information reporting. The implementation is ongoing and is expected to continue over the next few years.\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. A s such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThere were no changes in V erizon's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control ov er financial reporting.",

Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The purchase of spectrum rights is presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets.

The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the ex cess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment (see Note 18).\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to projections of future revenues and certain operating expenses, operating margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit's underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ.\n\nTo test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets ex ceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.\n\nThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the ex cess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. The Company has determined that there are currently no legal, competitive, economic or other factors that materially limit the useful life of our trademarks and FCC licenses, which are our most significant indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nFinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 5 to 40 years. The costs to periodically renew our intangible assets are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Company expects its aggregate annual amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for fiscal 2025 through 2029 to be as follows:\n\n",

Our qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair v alue of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Consumer reporting unit in accordance with our policy . We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates. Our assessment indicated that the fair value of our Consumer reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment for our Business reporting unit given the low excess of fair value over carrying value identified in our 2022 annual impairment assessment and increased competitive and market pressures experienced throughout 2023. These pressures resulted in lower projected cash flows primarily driven by secular declines in wireline services and products across our Business customer groups. In connection with V erizon's annual budget process in the fourth quarter of 2023, leadership completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of our Business reporting unit resulting in declines in financial projections driven by market dynamics as compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit's annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, changes in the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate and inflationary pressures also impacted the fair value of the reporting unit. We applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of our Business reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. As  a  result,  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  recorded  a  noncash  goodwill  impairment  charge  of  approximately  $5.8  billion  ($5.8  billion  after-tax )  in  our consolidated statement of income.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Google, and Netflix differ in their exposure to intellectual property litigation risks, particularly in terms of the types of claims they face, the technologies or content involved, and the potential financial or operational consequences outlined in their 2022 disclosures?",
      "answer": "Disney faces various intellectual property-related legal actions, including copyright and breach of contract claims, but expects no material liability. Google is involved in multiple high-profile IP lawsuits, including the concluded Oracle Java API case and ongoing antitrust-related IP disputes, with potential consequences including damages, import restrictions, and changes to business practices. Netflix highlights exposure to third-party IP claims involving its streaming technology, recommendation systems, and content, noting that defending against such claims could result in costly litigation, service disruptions, or the need to remove content from its platform. While all three companies face IP litigation risks, the nature and scope of these risks vary significantly across their respective business models.",

          "chunk_text": "From  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  formal  and  informal  inquiries  and  investigations  on  competition  matters  by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws  relating  to  its  advertising  technology.  On  June  22,  2021,  the  EC  opened  a  formal  investigation  into  Google's advertising  technology  business  practices.  On  July  7,  2021,  a  number  of  state  Attorneys  General  filed  an  antitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC and other regulators around the world.\n\n## Patent and Intellectual Property Claims\n\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of  our  products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate  intellectual  property  disputes  because  an  ultimate  loss  in  an  ITC  action  can  result  in  a  prohibition  on  importing infringing  products  into  the  U.S.  Because  the  U.S.  is  an  important  market,  a  prohibition  on  importation  could  have  an adverse  effect  on  us,  including  preventing  us  from  importing  many  important  products  into  the  U.S.  or  necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\n\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\n\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging  that  Google's  Android  operating  system  infringes  Oracle's  copyrights  related  to  certain  Java  application programming interfaces (Java APIs). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the  Solicitor  General  regarding  our  petition.  On  September  27,  2019,  the  Solicitor  General  recommended  denying  our petition,  and  we  provided  our  response on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition  and  made a decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling and found that Google's use of the Java APIs  was  a  fair  use  as  a  matter  of  law.  The  Supreme  Court  remanded  the  case  to  the  Federal  Circuit  for  further proceedings  in  conformity  with  the  Supreme  Court  opinion.  On  May  14,  2021,  the  Federal  Circuit  entered  an  order affirming the district court's final judgment in favor of Google. On June 21, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court, and the case is now concluded.\n\n## Other\n\nWe  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims,  suits,  regulatory  and  government  investigations,  other  proceedings,  and consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms,  personal  injury,  consumer  protection,  and  other  matters.  For  example,  we  have  a  number  of  privacy investigations  and  suits  ongoing  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Such  claims,  suits,  regulatory  and  government  investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.",

Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\n\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology, title selection processes, our content, and marketing activities.\n\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\n\n## Risks Related to Information Technology\n\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\n\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity risks. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.\n\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyberattacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. Our insurance does not cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access.

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and AT&T (T) each characterize their exposure to supply chain risks, and what does this reveal about how their respective business models (cloud & device manufacturing, consumer hardware, and telecom infrastructure) shape the nature and management of these risks?",
      "answer": "Google (GOOGL) highlights its reliance on contract manufacturers and component suppliers for devices and technical infrastructure, noting that disruptions could affect its ability to supply products and services. The company also emphasizes the importance of managing costs and execution risks in its supply chain. Meta (META) faces supply chain risks primarily in its consumer hardware products, where it depends on a small number of third-party manufacturers, often concentrated in Asia. The company notes potential disruptions from supply or labor shortages, geopolitical tensions, and trade disputes that could delay product development and increase costs. AT&T (T), while not explicitly detailing supply chain risks in the provided excerpt, operates within a telecom infrastructure model that typically involves reliance on specialized vendors for network equipment and services. This implies a different exposure\u2014more focused on long-term vendor relationships and regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure\u2014compared to the consumer-facing hardware and cloud infrastructure models of Google and Meta. The contrast reveals that supply chain risks for tech and communication companies are highly dependent on their core business models: consumer hardware firms face logistics and geographic concentration risks, while telecom providers may face more regulatory and vendor-specific dependencies.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL \u2192 Supply Chain Risks: Google discloses reliance on contract manufacturers and component suppliers for devices and technical infrastructure, with risks related to execution, cost, and supply disruptions.",

        "Hop 3: T \u2192 Supply Chain Risks: AT&T\u2019s business model centers on telecom infrastructure, implying reliance on specialized vendors for network equipment and services, suggesting a risk profile more tied to regulatory compliance and long-term vendor relationships than to consumer logistics."

      "answer": "Alphabet (GOOGL) emphasizes structural governance provisions and concentrated voting power that could discourage a change of control, including dual-class stock structures and board powers. Meta (META) highlights the outsized influence of Mark Zuckerberg over corporate decisions and the potential impact of his unavailability on governance, which could affect change of control dynamics. Netflix (NFLX) discusses financial obligations tied to a change of control event, specifically the right of note holders to require Netflix to repurchase senior notes at 101% of principal plus accrued interest. Together, these perspectives illustrate how governance, leadership concentration, and debt covenants shape each company's exposure and response to potential change of control scenarios.",

      "question": "How do Netflix, AT&T, and Verizon each describe their competitive dynamics with cable companies, and what does this reveal about the evolving landscape of the communication services sector?",
      "answer": "Netflix describes cable network operators as traditional providers of entertainment video that are increasing their streaming offerings, posing a competitive threat due to their large customer bases, strong brand recognition, and significant financial resources. AT&T highlights that cable companies compete with them in broadband and legacy voice/data services, particularly in U.S. markets where they vie for customers using fiber, wireless, and internet-based services. Verizon notes that cable companies, such as Comcast and Charter, compete with them in wireless services through reseller arrangements and also challenge their Fios and wireline services. Together, this reveals a sector-wide shift where cable companies are expanding beyond traditional TV and broadband to compete across multiple service lines, including wireless and streaming, forcing major players like Netflix, AT&T, and Verizon to adapt their strategies across content, network infrastructure, and bundled offerings.",

The scale of our business and breadth of our products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and complexity of our business. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including restructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to scale down our office facilities. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased difficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and strategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as  well  as  other  disruptions  to  our  operations. As  our  organization  continues  to  evolve,  and  we  are  required  to  implement  and  adapt  complex   organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\n## We have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.\n\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make our Family products available in a total of more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\n- political, social, or economic instability;\n- risks  related  to  legal,  regulatory,  and  other  government  scrutiny  applicable  to  U.S.  companies  with  sales  and  operations  in  foreign  jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax , law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, accessibility, licensing, and infrastructure matters;\n- potential  damage  to  our  brand  and  reputation  due  to  compliance  with  local  laws,  including  potential  censorship  or  requirements  to  provide  user information to local authorities;\n- enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards, terms of service, and other policies across different languages and countries;\n- fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\n- foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\n- higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n- enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n- burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal,",

Lower than assumed investment returns, an increase in our benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur. We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income. Therefore, an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results.\n\nSignificant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans' funded status.\n\n## Inflationary pressures on costs, such as inputs for devices we sell and network components, labor and distribution costs, may impact our network construction, our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAs a provider of telecommunications and technology services, we sell handsets, wireless data cards, wireless computing devices and customer premises equipment manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services and depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment, and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. In recent years, the costs of these inputs and the costs of labor necessary to develop, deploy and maintain our networks and our products and services have increased. In addition, many of these inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, demand for raw materials used in the production of these devices and network components, severe weather, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. Inflationary and supply pressures may continue into the future and could have an adverse impact on our ability to source materials.\n\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful. Higher product or service prices may result in reductions in sales volume or increases in subscriber churn. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and services and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during a period of inflationary pressure or an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity and cost-saving initiatives.\n\n## Adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers' and suppliers' ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations.\n\nIn recent years, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation and the interest rate environment produced volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. Volatility may affect companies' access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or, in some cases, the inability to fund ongoing operations. In addition, we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations, including contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper. These financial institutions face stricter capital-related and other regulations in the United States and Europe, as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios, which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit.\n\nA company's cost of borrowing is affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies, and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects. While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed, adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions, severely affecting our business operations. Additionally, downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which could negatively impact our liquidity.

      "question": "How do Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Netflix (NFLX) each address their relationships with content providers, and what does this reveal about the strategic importance and financial implications of these relationships in the digital media ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Google (GOOGL) emphasizes the importance of content providers in maintaining platform trust and brand strength, noting that third-party content shared on its platforms can negatively impact its reputation and user confidence. Meta (META) explicitly depends on content providers, particularly for licensed video and music, and incurs content costs that are expensed either when titles are accepted or over the contractual license period, directly affecting its cost of revenue. Netflix (NFLX) depends heavily on content providers for its core business, licensing distribution rights from studios and rights holders to deliver content to its members, and highlights the regulatory and licensing risks associated with these relationships. Together, these perspectives reveal that while all three companies rely on content providers, the nature and financial impact of this reliance varies significantly across their business models.",

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. We may also not be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the ev olv ing nature of our business, our historical rev enue growth rate and historical operating margin may  not  be  indicativ e  of  our  future  performance.  For  additional  information,  see  T rends  in  Our  Business  and  Financial  Effect  and  Rev enues  and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable,  and  any  inability  to  protect  them  could  reduce  the  value  of  our  products ,  s ervices ,  and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various ev ents outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, serv ices, and technologies. For example, effectiv e intellectual property protection may not be av ailable in ev ery country in which our products and serv ices are distributed or made av ailable through the Internet. Also, the efforts we hav e taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectiv e. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innov ations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innov ations. Moreov er, we may not hav e adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innov ations that later turn out to be important. T here is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\n\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. T he secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitiv e information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitiv e  adv antage  resulting  from  these  trade  secrets.  We  also  face  risks  associated  with  our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word 'Google' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word 'search.' Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word 'Google' to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\n\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensiv e to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\n\nOur strong brands hav e significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innov ativ e products and serv ices that better serv e the needs of our users, adv ertisers, customers, content prov iders, and other partners. Our brands hav e been, and may in the future be, negativ ely affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data priv acy and security issues and developments,  and  product  or  technical  performance  failures.  For  example,  if  we  fail  to  respond  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  misinformation  or objectionable content on our serv ices and/or products or objectionable practices by adv ertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\n\nFurthermore,  failure  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brands  could  harm  our  business,  reputation,  financial  condition,  and  operating  results.  Our success  will  depend  largely  on  our  ability  to  remain  a  technology  leader  and  continue  to  prov ide  high-quality,  trustworthy,  innov ativ e  products  and serv ices that are truly useful and play a v aluable role in a range of settings.\n\n## We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our serv ices.\n\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our dev ices as well as serv ers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to supply components and distribute our products and serv ices. Our business could be negativ ely affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adv erse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Content Costs\n\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights ex tend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

      "answer": "DIS highlights that pricing pressure in the DTC streaming market is affecting subscriber retention and profitability, as consumers may not be willing to pay for multiple services at increasing prices, especially during periods of high inflation. T notes that pricing pressure is a result of aggressive competition in the wireless market, where rivals are offering competitive pricing and promotional strategies that threaten its ability to maintain margins. VZ similarly acknowledges pricing pressure due to evolving economic conditions and aggressive commercial offers from wireless competitors, which challenge its ability to retain customers and maintain profitability. While all three companies cite pricing pressure as a material risk, DIS focuses on consumer fatigue with subscription costs, T emphasizes competitive pricing strategies and network investment costs, and VZ highlights macroeconomic and competitive dynamics affecting customer behavior and service pricing.",

        "Hop 1: DIS \u2192 Pricing Pressure: DIS states that consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC services at increasing prices, especially during periods of high inflation, which negatively affects subscriber retention and profitability.",

GOOGL emphasizes that it is subject to a growing number of AI-specific regulations globally, particularly in areas like content moderation and data privacy, which increase compliance costs and complexity. META also states that changes in the regulatory environment\u2014specifically around AI, privacy, and content\u2014pose financial and operational risks, including potential fines or consent decrees.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\nOur services, products and properties are vulnerable to damage from the occurrence of certain events, including natural disasters, severe weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, and a range of other unforeseeable events such as infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts including degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, a reduction in demand for our products, services and theme parks, disruption of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and damage to our or our customers' or vendors' equipment and properties. These events also may result in lost revenue and large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties, products and services and could lead to litigation and regulatory fines or remedial measures, including if we inadvertently contributed to damages suffered by others.\n\nThe amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from these types of events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. We expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such event will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\n\n## The loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\nWe rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our businesses. While we maintain long-term and emergency transition plans for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidates or attract outside candidates to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel, the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nIn addition, our Content &amp; Experiences business depends on the abilities and expertise of on-air and creative talent. If we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent, if the costs to attract or retain such talent increase materially, or if these individuals cause negative publicity or lose their current appeal, our businesses could be adversely affected.\n\n## Labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses.\n\nMany of the writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees in our  Content &amp;  Experiences business, are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Many of these collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of the agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could adversely affect us, which could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, and the resolution of any disputes may increase our costs. For example, the Writers G uild of America ('Writers Guild') and the Screen Actors G uild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ('SAG ') work stoppages in 2023 paused productions, which reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment. There can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreements as they expire or that we can renew them on favorable terms or without any work stoppages in the future.\n\nIn addition, labor disputes in sports organizations with which we have programming rights agreements of varying scope and duration could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\n\n## Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Governance Matters\n\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses.\n\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and federal laws and regulations. In the United States in particular, the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations affect significant aspects of our communications businesses.\n\nLegislators  and  regulators  at  all  levels  of  government  frequently  consider  changing,  and  sometimes  do  change,  ex isting  statutes,  rules  or  regulations,  or interpretations  of  ex isting  statutes,  rules  or  regulations,  or  prescribe  new  ones,  any  of  which  may  significantly  affect  our  businesses  and  ability  to  effectively compete. Applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming services and AI, may also affect our business. These legislators and regulators,  along  with  some  state  attorneys  general  and  foreign  governmental  authorities,  have  been  active  in  conducting  inquiries  and  reviews  regarding  our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content. T he costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations.",

      "answer": "Disney discloses that its ability to provide content depends on licensing rights from studios and content providers, with license periods and terms varying across its platforms. Netflix explicitly states that its business model relies on content providers and rights holders licensing distribution rights, and it faces growing regulatory requirements in various countries that impact content availability and ownership. In contrast, AT&T\u2019s filing contains no specific information about its dependency on content providers, suggesting a more opaque approach to content licensing transparency compared to Disney and Netflix.

Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix . This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the ex tent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and 1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our employees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of ex cellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our business. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better ex perience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\n\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix  employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it's important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we believe is important for success at Netflix . We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, V Ps, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\n\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Meta, and Netflix differ in their accounting treatments and strategic dependencies regarding payments to content providers, and what does this reveal about their platform economics and content cost structures?",
      "answer": "Disney (DIS) mentions partnerships with content providers but does not provide specific accounting treatments or cost structures related to these relationships, suggesting a more collaborative or internally managed content strategy. Meta (META) explicitly recognizes content provider costs as part of cost of revenue, with expenses tied to revenue generation, flat fees, or a combination, and capitalizes minimal amounts, indicating a direct and scalable cost model aligned with user engagement. Netflix (NFLX) relies heavily on licensed content from third-party providers, with its ability to offer content contingent on the terms and duration of these licenses, revealing a high dependency on external content providers and exposure to fluctuating licensing costs. The synthesis shows that Disney\u2019s approach appears less transparent and more partnership-oriented, Meta\u2019s is financially integrated and usage-based, and Netflix\u2019s is highly dependent on external licensing, reflecting different platform economics and risk profiles.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Content Costs\n\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. We pay fees to these content providers based on revenue generated, a flat fee, or both. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. V ideo content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum guaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Ex pensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Software Development Costs\n\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n\n## Share-based Compensation\n\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are ex pected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax  rates in the period of the enactment.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\n\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.06 billion, $2.02 billion, and $2.65 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.",

It estimates that a 10% adverse exchange rate change could have resulted in a $503 million adverse effect on income before income taxes as of December 31, 2023. META, while also exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily the Euro, has not historically used derivatives to hedge this exposure and instead recognizes transaction gains or losses directly in net income, with $366 million in foreign exchange losses recognized in 2023. T, on the other hand, mitigates foreign currency exchange risk on its long-term debt through cross-currency swaps that convert foreign-denominated debt into fixed-rate U.S. dollar obligations, effectively removing both interest rate and foreign exchange risk.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

DIS bypassed qualitative testing for its entertainment reporting unit and used discounted cash flow models to determine fair value, finding less than 10% excess over carrying value, with sensitivity to discount rate and cash flow assumptions. VZ performed a quantitative assessment for its Business reporting unit, recording a $5.8 billion goodwill impairment due to declining projections and macroeconomic pressures, with fair value highly sensitive to changes in terminal growth rate, discount rate, and EBITDA margin. Together, these cases show that all three companies rely on discounted cash flow techniques, but differ in how frequently they perform quantitative assessments and how sensitive their valuations are to changes in key assumptions.",

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights the risk of unauthorized copying and piracy of programming, noting that modifications to existing U.S. or international copyright laws could adversely affect its ability to license and sell content. The company actively enforces its intellectual property rights and spends substantial resources on protection. DIS emphasizes the global challenge of unauthorized digital copying and distribution, noting that inadequate laws or weak enforcement in one country can harm its worldwide operations. It also cites the uncertain legal landscape around AI tools as a potential threat to IP protection. NFLX specifically references the impact of foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, on the economics of content creation and distribution, and notes that changes in these laws could affect its anti-piracy efforts and IP exploitation. While all three companies face IP-related risks, CMCSA focuses on regulatory compliance and enforcement costs, DIS emphasizes global enforcement challenges and AI-related uncertainty, and NFLX highlights the impact of foreign regulatory frameworks on content economics.",

      "answer": "Google (GOOGL) highlights that data localization laws are part of broader privacy and data protection regulations that could limit data transfers and impact its business model, including the ability to offer services and pursue certain practices. Meta (META) emphasizes the evolving and inconsistent global regulatory landscape around data localization and mentions a EUR \u20ac1.2 billion fine from the Irish Data Protection Commission related to non-compliance with GDPR data transfer rules. Netflix (NFLX) notes that data localization and export restrictions are among the legal challenges that could force them to adjust business plans, including expansion or cessation of operations in certain countries. Together, these disclosures show that data localization laws pose significant compliance and operational risks across the communication services sector, with specific financial and strategic implications for each company.",

Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\n\n- Competition  and  technology  platforms'  business  practices: Laws  and  regulations  focused  on  large  technology  platforms,  including  the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal settlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play's billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as litigation and new and expected regulations in a range of jurisdictions, including, among others, in the UK, Japan, and India.\n- AI: Laws and regulations focused on the dev elopment, use, and prov ision of AI technologies and other digital products and serv ices, which could result  in  monetary penalties or other regulatory actions.  For example, the  EU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year transitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later time). T he EU AI Act introduces v arious requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into serv ice in the EU, including specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based. In the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal gov ernment's approach to AI regulation going forward, as the continued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executiv e Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Dev elopment and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor priv ate sector dev elopment of certain foundation models, remains subject to regulatory dev elopment. Several states are considering enacting or hav e already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer protection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal lev el, some states may mov e to regulate AI model dev elopment and  deployment.  Further,  at  the  federal  and  state  lev el,  there  hav e  been  v arious  proposals  (and  in  some  cases  laws  enacted)  addressing 'deepfakes' and other AI-generated synthetic media.\n- Data privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing of user or adv ertising-related data, including priv acy and data protection laws; laws affecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws); and laws requiring data portability (including the EU Data Act, as discussed further below).\n- Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directiv e on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which hav e introduced new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by  users  or  linked  to  from  our  platforms,  or  create  property  rights  in  news  publications  that  could  require  payments  to  news  agencies  and publishers, which may result in other regulatory actions.\n- Content moderation: Various  laws  cov ering  content  moderation  and  remov al,  and  related  disclosure  obligations,  such  as  the  EU's  Digital Services Act, Florida's Senate Bill 7072 and T exas' House Bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that  impose  penalties  for  failure  to  remov e  certain  types  of  content  or  require  disclosure  of  information  about  the  operation  of  our serv ices and algorithms, which may make it harder for serv ices like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptiv e, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression, which, in turn, could impact how our platforms are v iewed by  users. Additionally,  legislators  are  increasingly  focused  on  regulating  online  child  safety,  including  content  protections  for  minors  under eighteen years of age. These regulations could result in our hav ing to modify our products and serv ices and incur additional costs to operate and monitor minors' experiences on our products and serv ices.\n- Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU's New Deal for Consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\n\nIn  addition,  the  applicability  and  scope  of  these  and  other  laws  and  regulations,  as  interpreted  by  courts,  regulators,  or  administrativ e  bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the Digital Serv ices Act in Europe, to protect against liability for v arious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activ ities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may harm us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislativ e proposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements,  confidentiality  procedures,  non-disclosure  agreements  with  third  parties,  employee  disclosure  and  invention  assignment  agreements,  and  other contractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the ex pected lives of our products.\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, AI  and  machine  learning,  electronic  contracts  and  other  communications,  competition,  protection  of  minors,  consumer  protection,  civil  rights,  accessibility, telecommunications,  product  liability,  e-commerce,  tax ation,  economic  or  other  trade  controls  including  sanctions,  anti-corruption  and  political  law  compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\n\nThese  U.S.  federal  and  state,  EU,  and  other  international  laws  and  regulations,  which  in  some  cases  can  be  enforced  by  private  parties  in  addition  to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For ex ample, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in various ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under  Section  230,  and  any  such  changes  may  increase  our  costs  or  require  significant  changes  to  our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. For ex ample, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR \u20ac1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,",

For ex ample, the EU revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers' catalogs, and to require prominence of those works, and certain EU Member States have imposed additional investment obligations and levies.\n\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the execution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\n\n## We are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax  positions and other tax  attributes on a worldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state, local, and foreign tax  authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of income and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax  positions of companies and we have tax  audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall tax es could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Risks Related to Human Resources\n\n## We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, members of our executive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we ex perience high ex ecutive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry ex pectations, fail to maintain a positive reputation, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or maintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If ex piring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new content to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our ability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.",

      "question": "How do Disney, Meta, and AT&T each characterize their exposure to private litigation risks, and what does this reveal about the varying legal pressures facing media and communication services companies in 2024?",
      "answer": "Disney highlights that private litigation is part of a broader regulatory risk landscape, noting that changes in laws or enforcement could require additional compliance costs or restrict business strategies. Meta specifically discloses a $725 million settlement in a major privacy-related class action lawsuit, illustrating direct financial exposure to private litigation, particularly around data practices. AT&T emphasizes that private litigation, alongside regulatory changes, could materially increase operating costs and alter customer perceptions, especially in areas like privacy and data collection. Together, these perspectives show that while all three companies face litigation exposure, the nature and financial impact differ based on their core business models\u2014Disney through regulatory enforcement environments, Meta through high-profile data privacy suits, and AT&T through regulatory and litigation pressures tied to customer data and privacy laws.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Regulations applicable to our businesses impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nEach of our businesses, including our broadcast networks and television stations, is subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations, which impact the operations and profitability of our businesses. Some of these regulations include:\n\n- U.S. FCC regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See Item 1 - Federal Communications Commission Regulation.\n- Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to child safety. See Item 1 - Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.\n- Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.\n- Land planning, use and development regulations applicable to our theme parks operations.\n- Environmental protection regulations.\n- U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs, trade restrictions, anti-money laundering laws or currency controls.\n- Restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas. See Item 1 - International Content Regulation.\n- Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws and antitrust laws.\n\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities (or, if applicable, private litigation to enforce such laws and regulations) in any of these areas, or others, may require us to incur additional compliance costs, may restrict our ability to ex ecute on our business strategies as planned or offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. In addition, ongoing and future developments in international political, trade and security policy may lead to new regulations limiting international trade and investment and disrupting our operations outside the U.S., including our international theme parks and resorts operations in France, mainland China and Hong Kong. For example, in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions, including new prohibitions on the importation of goods from certain regions and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures; and U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming and online commerce. Further the legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as AI, is uncertain and evolving and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies in one or more of our businesses.\n\n## Our operations outside the U.S. are affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.\n\nOur operations outside the U.S. are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than, or in addition to, U.S. law. Laws in some international jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the U.S. These differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and our rights or ability to enforce rights are sometimes different than would be ex pected under U.S. law. Moreover, enforcement of laws in some international jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. In addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or U.S. anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. As a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. law alone governed these operations.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK\n\n## The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\n\nThe price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and may continue to be volatile. Various factors have impacted, and may continue to impact, the price of our common stock, including, among others, changes in management; variations in our operating results; variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts; changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate; the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor; events affecting the stock market generally; and the economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors described in this Item 1A. Some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact one or more of our businesses, including by increasing stock awards for our employees who participate in our stock incentive programs or limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nAs a multinational company with a complex and evolving business, we are, and expect to continue to be, subject to numerous claims, litigation, regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations, and other legal proceedings in jurisdictions around the world. Although we believe many of these matters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal proceedings in some instances on terms that  are  unfavorable  to  us.  In  addition,  we  may  become  subject  to  orders  or  consent  decrees  imposed  by  government  or  regulatory  authorities.  Any  such developments  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs,  ex pose  us  to  civil  and  criminal  liability  (including  liability  for  our  personnel)  or  penalties  (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have experienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in light of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\n\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid or limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss, including through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining guidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the G eneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to litigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful discrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax , competition and antitrust, stockholder, commercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations. Furthermore, as the number of our users and amount of our revenue have grown, our potential exposure to substantial damages awards and fines has increased.\n\nIn some instances, particularly with novel legal and factual claims, new regulatory regimes or statutes that have not previously been enforced, or where the nature or type of enforcement pursued against us is novel, it can be very difficult to assess the likelihood or extent of potential liabilities, including the nature and extent of injunctive or other non-monetary relief and the applicability and amount of any potential forfeitures, disgorgement, fines or penalties.  While we have identified below certain matters that we believe to be material, there can be no assurance that additional material losses or limitations on our activities will not result from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be material.\n\n## Privacy and Related Matters\n\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging various causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ( In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation ). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action.  On  December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors appealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state",

Involvement with foreign firms also exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n## Industry-Wide Factors:\n\nChanges to federal, state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings, as well as private litigation, could further increase our operating costs and/or alter customer perceptions of our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.\n\nOur subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation, while many of our competitors are not. In addition, our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the United States are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided. Our wireless subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC and in some instances, by state and local agencies. Adverse regulations and rulings by the courts, the FCC or states relating to broadband and wireless deployment,, could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks. The continuing growth of IP-based services, especially when accessed by wireless devices, has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us. In addition, in response to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) questioning whether cell sites transmitting C-Band spectrum could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, we voluntarily committed to temporary, precautionary measures near certain airports through January 1, 2028, which may have limited impacts to deployments and services. In addition, increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations, such as privacy issues, government requests or orders for customer data, and concerns about global climate change, have led to proposals or new legislation at state, federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations, which could result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. Enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to collect data and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. Should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customer-friendly environment, our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nExtreme weather events and other potential effects of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure, our ability to provide services, and may cause changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial results.\n\nThe potential physical effects of ex treme weather events and other potential effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, freezing conditions, sea-level rise and other climate-related events, could damage our networks and cause disruptions in our services, which could adversely affect our operations, infrastructure and financial results. Operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change, such as damage to our network infrastructure, could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. While we currently do not believe the potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change will be material, it is difficult to accurately and precisely calculate the future impacts of the physical effects of climate change given the dynamic nature of climate change's impacts on the environment.\n\nContinuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers.\n\nWireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage, including, in particular, the demand for faster and seamless usage of data across mobile and fixed devices. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization, as more customers consumed bandwidth from changes in work and learn from home trends. Streaming, augmented reality, 'smart' technologies, user generated content and artificial intelligence (AI) are ex pected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband. We must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations while remaining competitive. Improvements in these services depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services. In order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our non-fiber wireline areas, we have been expanding our all-fiber wireline network. We must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data, including video, and voice between cell and fixed landline sites. To this end, we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network.\n\nWe have spent, and plan to continue spending, significant capital and other resources on the ongoing development and deployment of our 5G and fiber networks. This deployment and other network service enhancements and product launches may",

For example, new domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights and human capital management, have been adopted or are under consideration, some of which include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response has increased our compliance costs, including from increased investment in technology and appropriate expertise and required the implementation of new reporting processes, entailing additional compliance risk.\n\nIn addition, we have undertaken or announced a number of related actions and goals, which will require changes to operations and ongoing investment. There is no assurance that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes or that we will achieve any of these goals. Consumer, government and other stakeholder perceptions of our initiatives often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brands. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or achieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain environmental sustainability goals or initiatives will depend in part on third-party collaboration, the availability of suppliers that can satisfy new requirements, mitigation innovations and/or the availability of economically feasible solutions at scale.\n\n## We face risks related to damage to our reputation or brands.\n\nOur reputation and globally recognizable brands are integral to the success of our businesses. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, some types of damage to our reputation or brands have an impact on all of our businesses. Because some of our brands are globally recognized, some types of brand damage are not locally contained. Maintenance of the reputation of our Company and brands depends on many factors, including the quality of our offerings, maintenance of trust with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. In addition, we may pursue brand or product integration combining previously separate brands or products targeting different audiences under one brand or pursue other business initiatives inconsistent with one or more of our brands, and there is no assurance that these initiatives will be accepted by our customers and not adversely impact one or more of our brands. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture, which may be amplified by social media, adversely impact our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, business opportunities, profitability, recruiting and valuation of our securities.\n\n## Various risks may impact the success of our DTC streaming services.\n\nThe success of our DTC strategy and profitability of our DTC streaming services will be impacted by the success of the reorganization of our media and entertainment business and the strategic change in our approach to content curation initiated in fiscal 2023; our ability to drive subscriber additions and retention based on the attractiveness of our content, manage churn, achieve the desired financial impact of our DTC pricing, bundling and distribution determinations, the Disney+ ad supported service, monetization and cost containment strategy and the launch of the ESPN flagship DTC service; and the effects of our determinations with regard to distribution for our creative content across windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation, and amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights are generally allocated across businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. Accordingly, our distribution determinations impact the costs of each business, including the applicable DTC service. There are a number of competing DTC businesses. Consumers may not be willing to pay for an expanding set of DTC services at increasing prices, potentially exacerbated by challenging economic conditions, such as during periods of high inflation or declines in economic activity. In addition, such economic conditions negatively impact the purchase of and price for advertising on our DTC streaming services. We face competition for creative talent and sports and other programming rights and are sometimes not successful in recruiting and retaining talent and obtaining desired programming rights and face increased costs to do so. We have experienced flat subscriber growth or net losses of subscribers in periods. Our content does not always successfully attract and retain subscribers in the quantities that we expect. Our content is subject to cost pressures and may cost more than we expect. We may not successfully manage our costs to meet our profitability goals. Government regulation, including revised foreign content and ownership regulations as well as government-imposed content restrictions, impacts the implementation of our DTC business plans. The highly competitive environment in which we operate puts pricing pressure on our DTC offerings and may require us to lower our prices or not take price increases to attract or retain customers or lead to higher churn rates. These and other risks may impact the profitability and success of our DTC streaming services.\n\n## Potential credit ratings actions, increases in interest rates, or v olatility in the U .S. and global financial markets could impede access to, or increase the cost of, financing our operations and investments.\n\nOur borrowing costs have been and can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies that are based, in part, on the Company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios.

While we inv est significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relev ant results and to detect and prev ent low-quality content and inv alid  traffic,  we  hav e  been  unable  and  may  continue to be unable to detect and prev ent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new av enues of abuse for bad actors.\n\nMany websites violate or attempt to v iolate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relev ance and utility would rank them. Such efforts hav e affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms  and  lead  them  to  display  false,  misleading,  or  undesirable  content. Although  English-language  web  spam  in  our  search  results  has  been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improv e their rankings. Although we continue to inv est in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prev ent web spam on our platforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may hav e negativ e experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect  our  users'  decisions  in  continuing  to  use  our  platforms.  We  also  face  other  challenges  from  low-quality  and  irrelev ant  content  websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improv e their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prev ent abuse from low-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including v iolations of our content guidelines inv olv ing incidents such as attempted election interference; activ ities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users, including minors, on- or off-line; and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nIf we fail to either detect and prev ent an increase in problematic content or effectiv ely promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for deliv ering relev ant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and div ert management's time and attention.\n\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\n\nOur products and serv ices depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant network capacity to  work  effectiv ely.  Currently,  this  access  is  prov ided  by  companies  that  hav e  significant  market  power  in  the  broadband  and  internet  access marketplace,  including  incumbent  telephone  companies,  cable  companies,  mobile  communications  companies,  and  gov ernment-owned  serv ice prov iders. Some of these prov iders hav e taken, or hav e stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees  to  us  or  our  users  to  prov ide  our  offerings,  or  by  prov iding  our  competitors  preferential  access.  Some  jurisdictions  hav e  adopted  regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access prov iders; howev er, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and serv ices hav e been subject to gov ernment-initiated restrictions or blockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, adv ertisers, and/or content prov iders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negativ ely affecting our business.\n\n## Risks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\n\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.\n\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as foreign laws and regulations cov ering a wide v ariety of subjects, and our introduction of  new  businesses,  products,  serv ices,  and  technologies  will  likely  continue  to  subject  us  to  additional  laws  and  regulations.  In  recent  years, governments around the world hav e proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relev ant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data priv acy and security, competition, AI, and online content.

For ex ample, our AI-related efforts, particularly those related to generative AI, subject us to risks related to harmful or illegal content, accuracy, misinformation and deepfakes (including related to elections), bias, discrimination, tox icity, consumer protection, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and sanctions and export controls, among others. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary liability, and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, activities that threaten people's safety or well-being on- or offline, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\n\nAs a result of the complexity and rapid development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies in jurisdictions around the world, which are applying, or are considering applying, platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, export controls, and data protection laws to AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI (such as the recently passed EU AI Act). We may not always be able to anticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these frameworks as they are still  rapidly evolving.  We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may develop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. G iven the long history of development in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to continue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical infrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the availability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\n\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that can use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize such AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the dissemination of illegal,  inaccurate,  defamatory  or  harmful  content,  intellectual  property  infringement  or  misappropriation,  furthering  bias  or  discrimination,  cybersecurity  attacks including  spear  phishing  attacks,  data  privacy  violations,  other  activities  that  threaten  people's  safety  or  well-being  on-  or  offline,  or  to  develop  competing technologies.  While  we  may  mitigate  certain  risks  associated  with  the  improper  use  of  our AI  models  through  both  technical  measures  and  the  inclusion  of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\n\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments regarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal liability.\n\n## We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\n\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our \"Y our Activity off-Meta Technologies\" tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users.

Additionally, in November 2024, we agreed to purchase select spectrum licenses from United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) for approximately $1,000, subject to closing conditions, including the consummation of UScellular's proposed sale of its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nIn North America, our network covers over 440 million people with 4G LTE and over 314 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology.\n\nBroadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to ex pand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\n\nCopper Decommissioning While building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our ex it strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\n\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading 'Segment Results' in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Business, Cricket, AT&amp;T PREPAID , AT&amp;T Fiber and AT&amp;T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. SM\n\nMobility Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. \u00ae\n\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, tex t and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\n\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&amp;T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.",

Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Areas of Regulation\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nCopyright,  trademark,  unfair  competition,  patent,  trade  secret  and  other  proprietary-rights  laws  of  the  United  States  and  other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal  protections  exist  to  combat  such  practices,  the  extent  of  copyright  protection  is  sometimes  ambiguous  and  the  use  of technological  protections  can  be  controversial.  Modifications  to  existing  laws,  a  weakening  of  these  protections  or  their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\n\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute.  The  cable  compulsory  copyright  license  and  the  royalties  we  pay  are  subject  to  audits  and  possible  regulatory  and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition,  the  landscape  for  music  licensing  is  constantly  changing,  and  music  fees  we  pay  are  subject  to  new  fee  demands  and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\n\n## Privacy and Data Security Regulation\n\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers' personal information. In the United States, the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators' nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers' personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests. We are  also  subject  to  various  state  and  federal  regulations  that  provide  privacy  protections  for  customer  proprietary  network information related to our voice services.\n\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For example, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer information. These enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly  evolving  technologies  and  methods  for  delivering  content  and  advertising  to  ensure  that  appropriate  notice  is  given  to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection, use or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  states  have  enacted  detailed  laws  establishing  explicit  consumer  privacy  protections  and  data  security requirements in  their  respective  states.  For  example,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy Act  ('CCPA')  gives  California  residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of 'Personal Information,' as well as rights to access, delete  and  restrict  the  sale  of  certain  personal  information  collected  about  them.  Moreover,  all  50  states  have  security  breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\n\nCertain  of  our  businesses  are  subject  to  the  European  Union's  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  ('GDPR')  and  the  United Kingdom's Data Protection Act 2018 ('DPA'), which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively. DPA, GDPR and the Member States' legislation implementing the GDPR, related  rules  regulating  the  privacy  of  electronic  communications services and networks (including 'cookie' rules), and various initiatives by regulatory authorities pursuant to these laws affect how we are able to process certain personal data for particular purposes, what we must tell our customers about this processing, and what controls our customers have over such processing.\n\nPrivacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2021. For example, new laws have been enacted in Virginia and Colorado, which come into effect in 2023 and include many requirements similar to those in the CCPA for companies that collect personal  information  from  consumers  in  those  states.  In  addition,  California  voters  approved  a  ballot  initiative  enacting  the California Privacy Rights Act ('CPRA'), which updates the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to oversee implementation and enforcement of the state's privacy laws. Changes enacted in the CPRA generally go into",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

      "question": "How do Disney, Netflix, and AT&T each manage their exposure to foreign currency-denominated debt, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to global financial risk?",
      "answer": "Disney reported $143 million in foreign currency denominated debt as of September 30, 2023, indicating relatively limited exposure. Netflix, in contrast, had \u20ac5,170 million (approximately $5.6 billion) in foreign currency notes outstanding as of December 31, 2023, with a remeasurement loss of $176 million during the year, showing significant exposure and volatility impact. AT&T had approximately $35.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated debt, including Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar obligations, as part of a much larger overall debt portfolio of $133.4 billion.

Certain  theatrical  titles  are  also  made  available  for  viewing  on  demand  following  a  shortened  theatrical  release window. After their initial release, we sell and license films globally through various methods. We license films, including titles following the theatrical release window and selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to DTC streaming  service  providers,  and  to  video  on  demand  and  pay-per-view  services  provided  by  multichannel  video  providers, including the Cable Communications and Sky segments. We also distribute films globally by selling them on DVDs and through digital distribution services.\n\nTheatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices and the percentage of ticket sale retention by the exhibitors and the",

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

      "question": "How do Google, Meta, and Verizon each apply the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, and what do their differing approaches reveal about their valuation strategies and risk exposures?",
      "answer": "Google accounts for certain non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which involves measuring these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes. Google also notes that these are primarily equity securities where they do not exercise control or significant influence over the investee. Meta, on the other hand, applies the measurement alternative to substantially all of its non-marketable equity securities, including its significant $6.14 billion investment in Jio Platforms Limited as of December 31, 2023, and adjusts the carrying value based on observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Verizon also elects the measurement alternative for equity securities without readily determinable fair values, measuring them at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. However, Verizon specifically emphasizes its matrix pricing method for debt securities without quoted prices, distinguishing its approach for different asset classes. Collectively, this reveals that while all three companies use the measurement alternative, they differ in the scope of its application, the types of investments covered, and the additional valuation techniques employed to manage risk and reporting accuracy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition, intellectual property constitutes a significant part of the value of our businesses, and our success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property rights of the content we create or acquire against third-party misappropriation, reproduction or infringement. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights. The legal landscape for new technologies, including AI, remains uncertain, and legal developments could impact our ability to protect against unauthorized third-party use, misappropriation, reproduction or infringement or impact our ability to deploy new technologies. Our use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may also increase our exposure to intellectual property claims.\n\nPiracy and other unauthorized uses of content are made easier, and the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging, by technological advances that allow  the  conversion  of  programming,  films  and  other  content  into  digital  formats,  which  facilitates  the  creation,  transmission  and  sharing  of  high-quality unauthorized copies. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for our businesses. For example, certain entities may stream our broadcast television content illegally online without our consent and without paying us any compensation, and sporting events on our international networks may be illegally transmitted. While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States. If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.\n\n## We may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support.\n\nWe depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services. We also rely on third-party satellite transponder capacity to provide video services in Europe, as well as on third-party wireless networks to offer  certain  wireless  services  in  the  United  States  and  internationally.  Some  of  these  vendors  represent  our  primary  source  of  supply  or  grant  us  the  right  to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software products. While we monitor the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties, there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulties associated with these vendors or that we could effectively mitigate our risks with respect to any such difficulties. If any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, including as a result of cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents, faulty software updates, or any other supply chain compliance-related issues, if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreements with us or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner (or at all), or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some products or services may be adversely affected and we may incur additional costs.\n\n## Our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments.\n\nOur success is, to a large ex tent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors' use of certain types of technology, including AI, and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage. New technologies can materially impact our businesses in a number of ways, including affecting the demand for our products, the distribution methods of our products and content to our customers, how we create our entertainment products, the ways in which our customers can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platforms available to advertisers. For example, current and new wireless internet technologies (including 5G  fixed wireless networks and 4G  and 5G  wireless broadband services) continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability for those services as compared with prior technologies and create further competition for our businesses. In addition, some companies and U.S. municipalities are building advanced fiber-based networks that provide very fast internet access speeds, and some providers offer newer satellite broadband services. We expect advances in communications technology to continue to occur in the future.\n\nIf we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers or that enhance our business operations, such as through the use of AI, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of multigigabit symmetrical speeds by leveraging our DOCSIS 4.0 technology and the development and enhancement of various streaming platforms. There can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future.  We  also  may  generate  less  revenue  or  incur  increased  costs  if  changes  in  our  competitors'  product  offerings  require  that  we  offer  certain  services  or enhancements at a lower or no cost to our customers or that we increase our research and development expenditures.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Our data platform also unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data gov ernance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud.\n- Applications: offers a broad applications portfolio, including Gemini for Google Cloud and Gemini for Google Workspace, as well as purposebuilt agents for Search and our Customer Engagement Suite. AI has been used in Google Workspace for years to improv e grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now , Gemini for Google Workspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, v isualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nAcross Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solv e big problems that affect a wide v ariety of industries, including transportation and health technology. Alphabet's inv estment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at v arious stages of dev elopment, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriv ing, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside inv estors. While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating rev enue and making important strides in their industries. Rev enues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptiv e technologies. We face formidable competition in ev ery aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:\n\n- general purpose search engines and information serv ices;\n- vertical  search  engines  and  e-commerce  prov iders  for  queries  on  topics  such  as  those  related  to  trav el,  jobs,  and  health,  which  users  may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n- online adv ertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming serv ices;\n- other forms of adv ertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and telev ision as our adv ertisers typically adv ertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n- digital content and application platform prov iders;\n- prov iders of enterprise cloud serv ices;\n- developers and prov iders of AI products and serv ices;\n- companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that hav e dev eloped proprietary platforms;\n- prov iders of digital v ideo serv ices;\n- social networks, which users may rely on for product or serv ice referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines;\n- prov iders of workspace communication and connectiv ity products; and\n- digital assistant prov iders.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heav ily on our ability to dev elop and distribute innov ativ e products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for adv ertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and serv ices are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relev ance of our adv ertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and av ailability of our products and serv ices;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliv er their adv ertisements in an efficient and effectiv e manner across a v ariety of distribution channels; and\n- content prov iders, primarily based on the quality of our adv ertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate rev enues from adv ertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.",

NFLX includes its Section 906 certification under Exhibit 32.1, marked as 'Filed Herewith,' indicating a more direct inclusion in the filing.

      "answer": "CMCSA competes with other content creators for talent, programming, and audience attention, particularly noting the rising costs of sports rights and the challenge of fragmented audience measurement. DIS compensates creative personnel through equity-based awards like stock options, emphasizing long-term incentives for executive, management, and creative talent. T's engagement with content creators is through partnerships, although specific details are not elaborated in the provided evidence. Together, these approaches reveal that CMCSA focuses on market-based competition, DIS invests in talent retention through financial incentives, and T leverages collaborative relationships to access content creation resources.",

The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations, channels, or digital platforms. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, online media and other digital sources. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\n\nOur television and streaming platforms compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other cable, broadcast and premium networks, DTC streaming and other OTT service providers, and local broadcast television stations. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost is significant.\n\nOur  cable  networks  compete  with  other  cable  networks  and  programming  providers  for  carriage  of  their  programming  by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. Our broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.\n\n## Studios\n\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences for our film and television content with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position  of  our  film  and  television  studios  primarily  depends  on  the  number  of  films  and  shows  and  episodes  produced,  their distribution  and  marketing  success,  and  consumer  response.  Our  film  and  television  studios  also  compete  to  obtain  creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on premium networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers.\n\n## Theme Parks\n\nTheme Parks competes with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and  recreational  activities.  To  help  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  our  theme  parks,  we  have  invested  and  continue  to  invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including the new theme parks in Beijing and Orlando.\n\n## Sky Segment\n\nSky is one of Europe's leading entertainment companies operating in six territories, including three of the largest pay television markets in Western Europe: the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. The majority of our revenue is derived from our direct-toconsumer business, which has 23.0 million customer relationships, and primarily involves the distribution of a wide array of video channels  to  both  residential  and  business  customers.  We  also  offer  broadband,  voice  and  wireless  services  individually  and  as bundled services in select countries. We own a diverse portfolio of pay television channels that feature entertainment, news, sports and movies, which are included in our subscription video services and are also licensed through various distribution partnerships to third-party video providers to reach an additional 3 million households. We also generate revenue from the licensing of owned and licensed programming to third-party video providers and from the sale of advertising.\n\n## Direct-to-Consumer\n\n## Video\n\nOur  direct-to-home  ('DTH')  video  services  are  delivered  primarily  through  a  combination  of  both  satellite  transmission  and broadband connections that are marketed under the Sky brand in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Ireland and Austria.

      "answer": "CMCSA emphasizes its reliance on third-party content from studios, sports organizations, and production companies to maintain a competitive edge in a fragmented media landscape, noting that rising costs for exclusive rights, particularly in sports, pose a financial risk. DIS leverages third-party content across its DTC platforms like Disney+ and Hulu, integrating it with its own IP to enhance subscriber value and engagement, with 123 million Disney+ subscribers as of September 2024. META highlights the importance of third-party content in maintaining user engagement on its platforms, but expresses concern that failure to attract and retain such content could lead to declines in user sentiment and platform usage.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe number of entertainment choices available to consumers, including DTC streaming service providers and aggregators, social networking and user-generated content platforms,  and  gaming  and  virtual  reality  products  and  services,  continue  to  increase,  intensify  audience  fragmentation  and  disaggregate  how  content traditionally has been distributed to and viewed by consumers. The continuing trend of content owners, including us with Peacock, delivering their content directly to  consumers,  rather  than  through,  or  in  addition  to,  traditional  video  distribution  channels  also  disrupts  traditional  media  distribution  business  models.  As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming services in lieu of linear video services, which continue to experience accelerated net customer losses, our video customers and video revenues, and linear television network subscriber fees received from video service providers, each decrease. In addition to reducing traditional television viewership, these trends when coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused, and likely will continue to cause, audience ratings declines for our television networks. Shifting content consumption patterns also may result in lower demand for home entertainment products or theatrical attendance. While we have adapted some of our video and content offerings to compete in the evolving media distribution landscape, such as by offering Peacock and NOW, there also can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete or that Peacock will grow or sustain its revenue or user base, successfully compete as a stand-alone DTC streaming service or fully offset decreases to our linear television networks' results of operations.\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nWe compete for the sale of advertising time with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers as advertisers have shifted, and may continue to shift, a larger portion of their total expenditures to digital media. We also compete with other online content providers, such as social  networking  platforms  and  user-generated  content  providers,  television  networks  and  stations,  and  all  other  advertising  platforms.  Because  we  derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models or on Peacock, could negatively impact our results of operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, declines caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries and economic conditions generally; increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, audience fragmentation and viewing content on DTC streaming services; use of time-shifting or advertising-blocking technologies; and regulatory intervention on advertising placement. Lower audience ratings  and  reduced  viewership,  which  many  of  our  linear  television  networks  have  ex perienced,  and  likely  will  continue  to  ex perience,  as  well  as  the  level  of popularity of Peacock, affect advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us and the rates paid. Advertising sales and rates also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if our content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance.\n\nWe create and acquire media, sports and entertainment content, the success of which depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. To meet the changing preferences of our consumer markets, we must consistently create, acquire, market and distribute a broad array of content and theme park attractions. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content, such as the production of films and original content for television networks and streaming services, and in the creation of new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance.\n\nWe obtain a significant portion of our content from third parties, such as movie studios, television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense. Entering into or renewing contracts for such content rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in significantly increased costs, potentially over an extended contractual term. Particularly with respect to contracts for sports rights, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers or to grow and retain subscribers to our own DTC services. There can be no assurance that revenue generated from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights and of producing and distributing the programming. In addition, media companies may determine not to license popular content to us, and as more content owners offer their content directly to consumers through their own platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the content they license to our linear television networks or Peacock. The inability to enter into or renew some or all of these contracts on acceptable terms could reduce the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect our results of operations and businesses.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Outside the U.S., Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar also include international sports programming. The services are offered individually or in various bundles, which may include ESPN+ (see Sports segment discussion), to customers directly or through third-party distributors on mobile and internet connected devices. The majority of Direct-to-Consumer revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising.\n\n## Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar\n\nDisney+ is a subscription-based DTC service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming, which are all top-level selections or 'tiles' within the Disney+ interface. In the U.S., subscribers to both Disney+ and Hulu may access certain Hulu programming through a tile on Disney+. Outside the U.S., Disney+ includes a Star branded tile, which features general entertainment programming. In Latin America, Disney+ includes an ESPN branded tile, which features a variety of sports content including live events. The Company plans to launch an ESPN branded tile on Disney+ in the U.S. in early fiscal 2025.\n\nIn certain Latin American countries prior to July 2024, we offered Disney+ as well as Star+, a standalone service with a variety of general entertainment and family content and live sports programming. At the end of June 2024, we merged these services into a single Disney+ product offering.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 123 million.\n\nDisney+ Hotstar is a subscription-based DTC service available in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Programming includes television shows, movies, sports and original series in approx imately 10 languages, in addition to gaming and social features. Disney+ Hotstar has exclusive streaming rights to certain cricket programming.\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Disney+ Hotstar subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 36 million.\n\nDisney+ and Disney+ Hotstar offer content from the Company's various studios, including library titles, as well as content acquired from third parties.\n\nThe majority of Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar revenue is derived from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, advertising. The Company offers an adsupported Disney+ service in the U.S., Canada and select Latin American and European markets.\n\n## Hulu\n\nHulu is a domestic subscription-based DTC service with general entertainment content from the Company's various studios as well as content licensed from third parties. Hulu's revenue is derived from subscription fees and advertising. Hulu offers subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services with or without advertising in addition to a digital OTT MVPD (Live TV) service. The Live TV service is available with either of Hulu's SVOD services and includes live linear streams of various cable and broadcast networks. In addition, Hulu offers subscriptions to premium services such as Max, Cinemax, Starz and Paramount+ with Showtime, which can be added to the Hulu service. Certain programming from ABC Network, Freeform and FX Channels is also available on the Hulu SVOD service one day after the linear airing on these channels. As of September 28, 2024, the estimated number of paid Hulu subscribers, based on internal management reports, was approximately 52 million.\n\n## Content Sales/Licensing and Other\n\nThe majority of Content Sales/Licensing revenue is derived from TV/VOD, theatrical and home entertainment distribution. In addition, revenue is generated from music distribution, stage plays and post-production services through Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound.\n\nThe Company also publishes National Geographic magazine, which is reported with Content Sales/Licensing.\n\n## TV/VOD Distribution\n\nWe license our content to third-party television networks, television stations and other video service providers for distribution to viewers on television or a variety of internet-connected devices, including through other DTC services.\n\n## Theatrical Distribution\n\nThe Company licenses full-length live-action and animated films to theaters globally. Cumulatively through September 28, 2024, the Company has released approximately 1,100 full-length live-action films and 100 full-length animated films. In the domestic and most major international markets, we generally distribute and market our films directly. In certain international markets our films are distributed by independent companies. In some territories, certain films may be ex clusively distributed on our DTC streaming services. During fiscal 2025, we expect to release approximately 15 films.",

      "answer": "CMCSA highlights its dependency on content providers for programming, indicating a reliance on third-party content to maintain its competitive position in the media and entertainment space. META discloses that it pays fees to content providers for licensed video and music, either based on revenue generated, flat fees, or a combination, and notes that these costs are expensed either when the content is accepted or over the license period. NFLX emphasizes that its ability to provide content to members depends on licensing rights from studios and content providers, and it faces risks related to the variability of license terms and potential disputes over intellectual property. Collectively, this shows that while all three companies rely on content providers, they manage this dependency differently\u2014CMCSA through broad programming needs, META through structured licensing models tied to performance or flat fees, and NFLX through a direct dependency on licensing access with exposure to regulatory and contractual risks.",

NFLX experienced a $1,104 million increase in content amortization costs in 2024, reflecting its heavy investment in both existing and new original content.

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024 and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in 2025.\n\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content &amp; Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers G uild and the SAG  work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\n\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

NFLX notes that Delaware law could be used by its board to delay or prevent a takeover, and acknowledges that its charter documents contain provisions like classified boards and supermajority voting requirements that discourage takeovers.

The repurchase program does not hav e an expiration date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash div idends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 billion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectiv ely.\n\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash div idends in the future, subject to rev iew and approv al by the company's Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\n\n## Note 12. Net Income Per Share\n\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using  the  weighted-av erage  number  of  shares  outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  net  income  per  share  is  computed  using  the  weighted-av erage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutiv e securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutiv e securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutiv e effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conv ersion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conv ersion of those shares.\n\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and div idend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to v oting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law , which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share div idends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law prov ides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would hav e the effect of adv ersely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a giv en class of stock must be approv ed by the class of stock adv ersely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation prov ides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder v ote, it must be approv ed by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.",

We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\n\n## The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\n\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock, including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\n\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for ex ample, Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\n\n## Our status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly, should the  interests  of  our  controlling  stockholder  differ  from  those  of  other  stockholders,  the  other  stockholders  may  not  have  the  same  protections  afforded  to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\n\n## Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware G eneral Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\n- until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\n- we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\n\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\n\n## Our stock price is volatile.\n\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\n- variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow;\n- variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n- announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n- competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n- market volatility in general;\n- the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n- the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n- the operating results of our competitors; and\n- other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\n\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\n\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may ex perience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\n## Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the adsupported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the ex pectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the",

Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company's derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 17.\n\nLevel 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.\n\nLevel 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.\n\nLevel 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe Company's financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measure\n\nThe Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges as disclosed in Notes 4 and 18. Fair value was determined using estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 2 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).\n\n## Credit Concentrations\n\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments on an ongoing basis and does not currently anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n\nThe Company does not expect that it would realize a material loss, based on the fair value of its derivative financial instruments as of September 28, 2024, in the event of nonperformance by any single derivative counterparty. The Company generally enters into derivative transactions only with counterparties that have a credit rating of A- or better and requires collateral in the event credit ratings fall below A- or aggregate ex posures ex ceed limits as defined by contract.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairo s as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements.  This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions totaling $73 million, $145 million, and $52 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.\n\n## Hulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn  2019,  we  entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  with  The  Walt  Disney  Company  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries,  whereby  we  relinquished  our  board  seats  and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. Concurrent with these agreements, we also acquired additional ownership interest in Hulu previously held by AT&amp;T. Following these transactions, our interest was approximately 33% and we had the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of future equity capital calls. The agreements included put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we could require Disney to buy, and Disney could require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended these agreements and agreed, among other things, that the put/call provisions regarding our interest could be exercised in November 2023 (in addition to subsequent periods) and that we would fund our share of prior equity capital calls if the put/call was ex ercised in November 2023.\n\nIn November 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Disney paid us $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu's minimum equity value, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. Additional proceeds for any ex cess of the fair value of our interest over the $9.2 billion minimum equity value will be due following final determination of Hulu's fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process. In connection with the transaction, Disney also agreed to share with us 50% of the future tax benefits resulting from the purchase of our interest in Hulu. Because we continue to hold our interest in Hulu, the $9.2 billion payment from Disney is treated as an advance on the sale of our interest, which will be recognized following the finalization of the appraisal process. The receipt of the minimum proceeds resulted in a tax gain in 2023. The recorded value of our investment in Hulu of $883 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, continues to reflect our historical cost in applying the equity method, and therefore, is less than its fair value.\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which was fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan was due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of the proceeds under the put/call provisions and was repaid in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWe present the advance on the sale of our  investment  and  the  term  loan  separately  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  in  the  captions  'advance  on  sale  of investment' and 'collateralized obligation,' respectively.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe classify investments with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method as marketable equity securities and the carrying values are primarily presented in other current assets. The changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities between measurement dates are recorded in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The fair values of our marketable equity securities are based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market prices.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\n\n## Equity Investment Risk\n\nOur  marketable  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  subject  to  a  wide  v ariety  of  market-related  risks  that  could  substantially  reduce  or increase the fair v alue of our holdings.\n\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are inv estments in priv ately held companies, some of which are in the startup or dev elopment stages.\n\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair v alue based on readily determinable market v alues, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price v olatility, and represent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our inv estments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A hypothetical adv erse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into deriv ativ es to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair v alue for observ able transactions for identical or similar inv estments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternativ e). T he fair v alue measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair v alue as of the balance sheet date. These inv estments, especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies hav e under dev elopment are typically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our inv estment in these companies. Valuations of our equity inv estments in priv ate companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily av ailable market data and",

      "question": "How do CMCSA's supply of streaming infrastructure, DIS's sports-focused DTC offerings, and NFLX's original content strategy each reflect distinct competitive approaches to capturing market share in the streaming services sector?",
      "answer": "CMCSA provides the foundational infrastructure for streaming services, positioning itself as a critical enabler of the industry rather than a direct content competitor. This infrastructure support allows CMCSA to remain neutral while benefiting from the growth of streaming platforms. DIS, on the other hand, is focusing on sports content through its ESPN+ DTC service and plans for a new DTC offering in fall 2025 that includes live linear streams of ESPN channels. DIS also attempted to launch Venu Sports, a joint venture with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, though it was blocked by a preliminary injunction. This approach highlights DIS's reliance on exclusive live sports content to differentiate its streaming offerings. NFLX, in contrast, is doubling down on original programming and exclusive content to attract and retain subscribers globally. It also faces risks related to content production, licensing, and increasing competition from traditional and internet-based providers. By combining infrastructure, sports content, and original programming strategies, the three companies reveal different pathways to capturing streaming market share: enabling the ecosystem, leveraging exclusive live content, and investing in proprietary programming.",

      "question": "How does the placement of Clawback Policies in SEC exhibit listings by Alphabet (GOOGL), Netflix (NFLX), and AT&T (T) reflect differences in the prominence and framing of these policies relative to compensation-related disclosures?",
      "answer": "Alphabet (GOOGL) lists its Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97.01) near the end of the exhibit list, grouped with XBRL-related filings and Sarbanes-Oxley certifications, suggesting a compliance-driven framing. Netflix (NFLX) includes its Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97.1) directly before XBRL financial statement filings, indicating a closer alignment with financial reporting. AT&T (T) places its Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97) immediately before XBRL filings and after a series of executive compensation exhibits, such as the Board of Directors Communications Concession Program and the Change-in-Control Severance Plan, implying a stronger connection to executive governance and compensation oversight.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: Alphabet (GOOGL) \u2192 Clawback Policy: Alphabet lists the Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97.01) at the end of the exhibit list, adjacent to XBRL filings and Sarbanes-Oxley certifications, suggesting it is treated more as a regulatory compliance item.",
        "Hop 2: Netflix (NFLX) \u2192 Clawback Policy: Netflix places its Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97.1) immediately before the Inline XBRL financial statement exhibits, indicating it is positioned as part of the financial reporting and transparency framework.",
        "Hop 3: AT&T (T) \u2192 Clawback Policy: AT&T locates its Clawback Policy (Exhibit 97) just before XBRL filings, but after several executive compensation-related exhibits, suggesting a framing more closely tied to executive governance and compensation oversight."

      "question": "How do DIS, GOOGL, and T each allocate to mortgage-backed securities within their investment portfolios, and what do these allocations suggest about their respective liquidity risk tolerance given the market volatility in 2022?",
      "answer": "DIS includes mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as part of its Level 2 investments, valued using broker quotes or evaluated prices based on market data, indicating a moderate approach to liquidity risk. GOOGL discloses that it invests in MBS as part of its cash equivalents and marketable securities, suggesting a more active liquidity management strategy, as these are considered highly liquid and available to support current operations. T specifically reports $94 million in MBS under Level 2 fixed income securities within its postretirement plan assets, reflecting a measured but limited exposure compared to its broader portfolio. Together, these allocations suggest that while all three companies incorporate MBS into their portfolios, they vary in scale and implied risk tolerance\u2014GOOGL appears most focused on liquidity, T maintains a modest and controlled exposure, and DIS manages MBS within a diversified, risk-controlled framework.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe primary investment objective for the assets within the master trust is the prudent and cost effective management of assets to satisfy benefit obligations to plan participants. Financial risks are managed through diversification of plan assets, selection of investment managers and through the investment guidelines incorporated in investment management agreements. Investments are monitored to assess whether returns are commensurate with risks taken.\n\nThe long-term asset allocation policy for the master trust was established taking into consideration a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the average age of participants, the number of retirees, the duration of liabilities and the expected payout ratio. Liquidity needs of the master trust are generally managed using cash generated by investments or by liquidating securities.\n\nAssets are generally managed by external investment managers pursuant to investment management agreements that establish permitted securities and risk controls commensurate with the account's investment strategy. Some agreements permit the use of derivative securities (futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) that enable investment managers to enhance returns and manage exposures within their accounts.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\n- Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable\n\nInvestments that are valued using the net asset value (NAV) (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy disclosure.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets reported at fair value. The methodologies used at October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 are the same.\n\nLevel 1 investments are valued based on reported market prices on the last trading day of the fiscal year. Investments in common and preferred stocks and mutual funds are valued based on the securities' exchange-listed price or a broker's quote in an active market. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on a broker's quote in an active market.\n\nLevel 2 investments in government and federal agency bonds and notes (excluding U.S. Treasury securities), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities are valued using a broker's quote in a non-active market or an evaluated price based on a compilation of reported market information, such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads and estimated default rates. Derivative financial instruments are valued based on models that incorporate observable inputs for the underlying securities, such as interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates.",

Our  financial  assets measured  at  fair  value  on  a  nonrecurring  basis  include  non-marketable  equity  securities.  Other  financial  assets  and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\n\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The  determination  of  fair  value  involves  the  use  of  appropriate  valuation  methods  and  relevant  inputs  into  valuation models.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nOur  financial  instruments  include  cash,  cash  equivalents,  marketable  and  non-marketable  securities,  derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable.\n\n## Credit Risks\n\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our  counterparty  creditworthiness,  credit  limits  and  use  of  collateral  management.  Foreign  exchange  contracts  are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived  from  revenues  earned  from  customers  located  around  the  world.  We  manage  our  credit  risk  exposure  by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\n\n## Cash Equivalents\n\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\n\n## Marketable Securities\n\nWe  classify  all  marketable  debt  securities  that  have  stated  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  from  the  date  of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  We  determine  the  appropriate  classification  of  our  investments  in  marketable  debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders' equity, except for the  changes  in  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses,  which  are  recorded  in  other  income  (expense),  net.  For  certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nOur  investments  in  marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  related  gains  and  losses, including unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions beyond twelve months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Non-Marketable Securities\n\nWe account for  non-marketable  equity  securities  through  which  we  exercise  significant  influence  but  do  not  have control over the investee under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions  for  identical  or  similar  investments  of  the  same  issuer.  Adjustments  are  determined  primarily  based  on  a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\n\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.",
