      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) highlights that legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing environmental concerns, including climate change and methane emissions, represent material risks that could impact project economics and operational flexibility. Chevron (CVX) emphasizes that changes to government policies in the countries where it operates, including environmental regulations and carbon pricing, are key uncertainties affecting its long-term planning and investment decisions. ExxonMobil (XOM) integrates government policies into its Energy Outlook, which underpins its Corporate Plan and asset impairment assessments, using assumptions about future greenhouse gas emission prices reflecting anticipated policy actions aligned with Paris Accord pledges. Together, these perspectives show that all three companies factor government policy into their strategic and financial planning, but with varying degrees of integration and emphasis on regulatory risk and opportunity.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nEnergy Outlook and Cash Flow Assessment. The annual planning and budgeting process, known as the Corporate Plan, is the mechanism by which resources (capital, operating expenses, and people) are allocated across the Corporation. The foundation for the  assumptions  supporting  the  Corporate  Plan  is  the  Energy  Outlook,  which  contains  the  Corporation's  demand  and  supply projections based on its assessment of current trends in technology, government policies, consumer preferences, geopolitics, and economic development. Reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Corporation, to meet net-zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Energy Outlook, and the Corporation's business plans will be updated accordingly.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the Corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on assumptions which are developed in the Corporate Plan, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, and are consistent with the criteria management uses  to  evaluate  investment  opportunities.  These  evaluations  make  use  of  the  Corporation's  assumptions  of  future  capital allocations,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  commodity  prices  including  price  differentials,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  volumes, development  and  operating  costs  including  greenhouse  gas  emission  prices,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  V olumes  are based  on  projected  field  and  facility  production  profiles,  throughput,  or  sales.  Management's  estimate  of  upstream  production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. The greenhouse gas emission prices reflect existing or anticipated policy actions that countries or localities may take in support of Paris Accord pledges. Cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.\n\nFair value of Impaired Assets. An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry  experts  and  government  agencies,  refining  and  chemical  margins,  drilling  and  development  costs,  operating  costs  and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.\n\nOther  Impairments  Related  to  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment. Unproved  properties  are  assessed  periodically  to  determine whether  they  have  been  impaired.  Significant  unproved  properties  are  assessed  for  impairment  individually,  and  valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the Corporation's future development plans, the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the Corporation expects to hold the properties. Properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.\n\nLong-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the assets are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about  the  recovery  of  costs  applicable  to  any  interest  retained  nor  any  substantial  obligation  for  future  performance  by  the Corporation.\n\nInterest  costs  incurred  to  finance  expenditures  during  the  construction  phase  of  multiyear  projects  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.\n\n## Environmental Liabilities\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe Corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Downstream and Chemical operations primarily use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and Singapore, which predominantly  sells  into  the  U.S.  dollar  export  market.  Upstream  operations  which  are  relatively  self-contained  and  integrated within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.\n\nFor  all  operations,  gains  or  losses  from  remeasuring  foreign  currency  transactions  into  the  functional  currency  are  included  in income.",

However,  some  countries  face  a  resurgence  of  the  virus  and  its  variants  (e.g.,  Delta, Omicron) that could impact demand for some of our products (e.g., jet fuel), workforce availability, timing of project start-ups and materials movement and pose a risk to our business and future financial results.\n\nChevron's  operations  have  continued  with  a  combination  of  on-site  and  at-home  work,  while  monitoring  local  vaccine  and transmission rates. In refining, the company continued to take steps to maximize diesel and motor gasoline production, given the decline in jet fuel demand.\n\nIn TCO, progress continued on FGP/WPMP. Staffing is at targeted levels and at the end of December 2021, over 90 percent of the TCO workforce on-site was fully vaccinated.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is mainly due to mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Note 17 Taxes provides the company's effective income tax rate for the last three years.\n\nRefer to the 'Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information' on page 2 and to 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A, on  pages  20  through  25  for  a  discussion  of  some  of  the  inherent  risks  that  could  materially  impact  the  company's  results  of operations or financial condition.\n\nThe company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company's financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.\n\nThe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nComments related to earnings trends for the company's major business areas are as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe  company  is  actively  managing  its  schedule  of  work,  contracting,  procurement,  and  supply  chain  activities  to  effectively manage  costs  and  ensure  supply  chain  resiliency  and  continuity  in  support  of  operational  goals.  Third  party  costs  for  capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company's control including, but not limited to: severe  weather  or  civil  unrest,  delays  in  construction,  global  and  local  supply  chain  distribution  issues,  the  general  level  of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry's material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company's costs reflect changes in market trends.",

The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.\n\nExploration and development program. Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our  exploration  and  development  efforts. Among  other  factors,  we  must  continuously  improve  our  ability  to  identify  the  most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget.\n\nProject and portfolio management. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses, as well  as  the  future  success  of  LCS  and  other  emerging  lower-emission  investments,  depends  on  complex,  long-term,  capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments,  suppliers,  customers,  or  others;  model  and  optimize  reservoir  performance;  develop  markets  for  project  outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project start-up or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence  the  performance  of  project  operators  where  ExxonMobil  does  not  perform  that  role.  In  addition  to  the  effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil's success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive returns to shareholders,  depends  on  our  ability  to  successfully  manage  our  overall  portfolio,  including  diversification  among  types  and locations of our projects, products produced, and strategies to divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategies. Additionally, we may retain certain liabilities following a divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liabilities than anticipated.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\nOperational  efficiency. An  important  component  of  ExxonMobil's  competitive  performance,  especially  given  the  commoditybased nature of many of our businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and improve production  yields  on  an  ongoing  basis.  This  requires  continuous  management  focus,  including  technology  improvements,  cost control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees.\n\nResearch  and  development  and  technological  change. To  maintain  our  competitive  position,  especially  in  light  of  the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement, ExxonMobil's technology, research, and  development  organizations  must  be  successful  and  able  to  adapt  to  a  changing  market  and  policy  environment,  including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to our businesses.\n\nSafety, business controls, and environmental risk management. Our results depend on management's ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spills or other adverse  environmental  events.  For  example,  we  work  to  minimize  spills  through  a  combined  program  of  effective  operations integrity management, ongoing upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and surveillance. Similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in response  to  government  requirements  but  also  to  address  community  priorities.  We  employ  a  comprehensive  enterprise  risk management  system  to  identify  and  manage  risk  across  our  businesses.  We  also  maintain  a  disciplined  framework  of  internal controls and apply a controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risks, or if our management systems and controls do not function as intended.",

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and ExxonMobil each quantify or describe the impact of evolving government policies on their energy transition strategies, reserve development timelines, and investment decisions in unconventional and low-carbon resources?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights that its net-zero operational emissions target by 2050 is subject to risks including government policies and potential regulations that may impair execution. The company may also need to purchase emission credits, which could become costly or unavailable. Chevron notes that government policies and regulations directly affect its reserve estimates and development timelines, with 1 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves remaining undeveloped for five or more years due to factors like infrastructure constraints and regulatory limitations. ExxonMobil emphasizes that regulatory changes and government policies influence project start-ups, production volumes, and its ability to achieve net-zero emissions goals in the Permian Basin by 2030, while also shaping investment decisions in LNG and Guyana developments.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported $879 million in sales and other operating revenues from Indonesia in 2022, with long-lived assets in the region declining to $28 million, indicating a reduced but ongoing presence. Chevron noted the expiration of the Rokan concession in Indonesia, which contributed to a production decrease, though the acquisition of Noble Energy partially offset broader production declines. ExxonMobil listed Indonesia as having open tax years from 2008 to 2021, suggesting a long-standing operational footprint with ongoing tax scrutiny. Together, these perspectives show COP maintaining a modest revenue stream, CVX experiencing a production-related setback, and XOM engaged in long-term tax oversight in Indonesia.",

Chevron (CVX) evaluates impairments based on triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves or price outlooks, and ExxonMobil (XOM) capitalizes exploratory well costs only when sufficient progress is made in assessing reserves and economic viability, otherwise expensing them.

          "chunk_text": "- Short-Term Investments -Short-term investments include investments in bank time deposits and marketable securities (commercial paper and government obligations) which are carried at cost plus accrued interest and have original maturities of greater than 90 days but within one year or when the remaining maturities are within one year. We also invest in financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities which are carried at fair value. Those instruments are included in short-term investments when they have remaining maturities within one year as of the balance sheet date.\n- Long-Term Investments in Debt Securities -Long-term investments in debt securities includes financial instruments classified as available for sale debt securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date.  They are carried at fair value and presented within the 'Investments and long-term receivables' line of our consolidated balance sheet.\n- Inventories -We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory.  The majority of our commodity-related inventories are recorded at cost using the LIFO basis.  We measure these inventories at the lower-of-cost-or-market in the aggregate.  Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis.  LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues.  Costs include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.  Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as tubular goods and well equipment, are valued using various methods, including the weighted-average -cost method and the FIFO method, consistent with industry practice.\n- Fair Value Measurements -Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability,  either directly or indirectly through market  -corroborated inputs.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n- Derivative Instruments -Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If the right of offset exists and certain  other criteria are met, derivative assets  and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative.  Gains and losses from derivatives not accounted for as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings.  We do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments.\n\n- Oil and Gas Exploration and Development -Oil and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.\n\nProperty Acquisition Costs -Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption PP&amp;E.  Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management's judgment.  Upon achievement of all conditions necessary for reserves to be classified as proved, the associated  leasehold costs are reclassified to proved  properties.\n\nExploratory Costs -Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.  Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or 'suspended,' on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found.  If economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.  If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and",

          "chunk_text": "This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the 'successful efforts' method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.\n\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However,  the  impairment  reviews  and  calculations  are  based  on  assumptions  that  are  generally  consistent  with  the  company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in  Note  18  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  to  the  section  on  Properties,  Plant  and  Equipment  in  Note  1  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are  made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable.  Similarly,  a  significant  downward  revision  in  the  company's  crude  oil  or  natural  gas  price  outlook  would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also,  if  the  expectation  of  sale  of  a  particular  asset  or  asset  group  in  any  period  has  been  deemed  more  likely  than  not,  an impairment  review  is  performed,  and  if  the  estimated  net  proceeds  exceed  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  or  asset  group,  no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value.  When  this  occurs,  a  determination  must  be  made  as  to  whether  this  loss  is  other-than-temporary,  in  which  case  the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's PP&amp;E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions  and  judgments,  including  such  factors  as  the  existence  of  a  legal  obligation,  estimated  amounts  and  timing  of settlements,  discount  and  inflation  rates,  and  the  expected  impact  of  advances  in  technology  and  process  improvements.  A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some  assumptions  would  have reduced  estimated  future  obligations,  thereby  lowering  accretion  expense  and  amortization  costs,  whereas  unfavorable  changes would  have  the  opposite  effect.  Refer  to  Note  25  Asset  Retirement  Obligations  for  additional  discussions  on  asset  retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.\n\nThe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported $159 million in sales from Indonesia in 2022, but had no revenue or long-lived assets in Indonesia by 2024, suggesting a reduced or exited presence. Chevron sold its Indonesia Deepwater assets in 2023, signaling a strategic withdrawal from upstream operations in the country. ExxonMobil, while no longer reporting current revenue from Indonesia, still references active Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with exploration periods of up to 10 years and total contract periods of 30 years, indicating a potentially ongoing but limited engagement. Together, these actions reflect a broader trend of Western energy majors reassessing or scaling back upstream investments in Indonesia amid shifting regional priorities and resource economics.",

          "chunk_text": "## United Kingdom\n\nAcreage terms are fixed by the government and are periodically changed. For example, many of the early licenses issued under the first four licensing rounds provided an initial term of six  years with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the initial term, subject to ex tension for a further 40 years. At the end of any such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate in all other areas. The majority of traditional licenses currently  issued  have  an  initial  ex ploration  term  of  four  years  with  a  second  term  ex tension  of  four  years,  and  a  final  production  term  of  18  years,  with  a mandatory relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.\n\n## Africa\n\n## Angola\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by either production sharing agreements or other concession contracts with initial exploration terms ranging from three to four years with options to extend from one to five years. The production periods range from 20 to 30 years, with extensions subject to negotiation with the National Concessionaire.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nExploration and production activities are generally governed by concession contracts with the G overnment of the Republic of Mozambique, represented by the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy. An interest in Area 4 offshore Mozambique was acquired in 2017. Terms for Area 4 are governed by the Exploration and Production Concession Contract (EPCC) for Area 4 Offshore of the Rovuma Block. The EPCC expires 30 years after an approved plan of development becomes effective for a given discovery area.\n\n## Nigeria\n\nExploration and production activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the national oil company, the  Nigerian  National  Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). NNPCL typically holds the underlying license or lease.  The terms of the  PSCs are generally 30 years (comprised of a 10-year exploration period and a 20-year production period).\n\nThe 2021 Petroleum Industry Act will govern any further renewals to the term of the PSCs, licenses, or leases.\n\n## Asia\n\n## Azerbaijan\n\nThe production sharing agreement (PSA) for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-G unashli field was established for an initial period of 30 years starting from the PSA execution date in 1994. The PSA was amended in September 2017 to extend the term by 25 years to 2049.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nExploration and production activities in Indonesia are generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production sharing contract (PSC). The current PSCs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended once for a period of four years with a total contract period of 30 years including an exploitation period. PSC terms can be extended for a maximum of 20 years for each extension with the approval of the government.\n\n## Kazakhstan\n\nOnshore exploration  and  production  activities  are  governed  by  the  production  license,  which  includes  ex ploration  activities  and  joint  venture  agreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.\n\nOffshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. The exploration period is six  years followed by separate appraisal periods for each discovery. The production period for each discovery, which includes development, is 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with the possibility of two 10-year ex tensions.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nProduction activities are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated with the national oil company. The PSCs have production terms of 25 years. Extensions are generally subject to the national oil company's prior written approval.",

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), and ExxonMobil (XOM) each characterize their operational footprint in Indonesia, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies in the Southeast Asian energy market?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) reported no sales revenue from Indonesia in 2023, down from $159 million in 2022 and $879 million in 2021, suggesting a declining or exited operational presence. Chevron (CVX) continues to maintain a presence in Indonesia as part of its international natural gas sales, indicating ongoing operational involvement. ExxonMobil (XOM) holds 0.1 million onshore acres in Indonesia at year-end 2023, signaling a modest but active exploration or production interest. Together, these perspectives suggest that while COP has largely withdrawn from Indonesia, CVX maintains a strategic presence and XOM retains a minor but active footprint, reflecting varied approaches to the Southeast Asian energy market.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Indonesia: COP reported $0 in sales revenue from Indonesia in 2023, down from $159 million in 2022 and $879 million in 2021, indicating a significant reduction or exit from operations in the country.",
        "Hop 2: CVX \u2192 Indonesia: Chevron includes Indonesia among its international natural gas sales markets, indicating continued operational involvement in the country as part of its broader global portfolio.",
        "Hop 3: XOM \u2192 Indonesia: ExxonMobil reported holding 0.1 million onshore acres in Indonesia at year-end 2023, suggesting a modest but active presence in the country's upstream sector."

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported extensions and discoveries in the Permian Basin as a key component of its Lower 48 unconventional plays, contributing to its crude oil reserves. Chevron highlighted a 14% increase in net oil-equivalent production, with growth in the Permian Basin being a primary driver. ExxonMobil reported an average production of 610 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian in 2023, a 60 thousand barrel increase over the prior year, and emphasized its acquisition of Pioneer to double its footprint in the Basin. Together, these disclosures indicate that while all three companies view the Permian Basin as a core growth area, they differ in scale, pace of expansion, and strategic emphasis on cost efficiency, integration, and emissions reduction.",

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), and ExxonMobil (XOM) apply the unit-of-production method to their proved oil and gas reserves, and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to asset valuation and depletion expense calculation?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) applies the unit-of-production method using proved oil and gas reserves estimated by internal reservoir engineers, with a DD&A expense of $8.1 billion in 2023. Chevron (CVX) uses the method on a per-field basis for proved developed reserves and also applies it to capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests. ExxonMobil (XOM) uses the unit-of-production method based on total proved oil and gas reserve volumes, but may switch to straight-line depreciation in cases where asset life does not align with reserve life.

Chevron emphasizes that its forward-looking statements are subject to government policy changes, particularly those related to climate regulation and carbon markets, which could significantly affect its operations and project economics. ExxonMobil notes that government policies will influence long-term demand for hydrocarbons and that its production forecasts and investment decisions in Guyana, the Permian Basin, and LNG projects are contingent on regulatory approvals and stable policy environments.

          "chunk_text": "Our ability to successfully execute on our plans to reduce operational GHG emissions intensity is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such reductions may be costly and challenging to achieve.\n\nOur framework for managing climate-related business risk is set out in our Climate Risk Strategy, which describes our strategic flexibility, approach to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, technology choices and engagement efforts. Among other things, we have set near- and medium-term GHG intensity reduction targets, as well as targets around flaring and methane. Our ability to achieve the stated targets, goals and ambitions within the Climate Risk Strategy's framework is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including government policies and markets, acceptance of carbon capture technologies, development of markets and potential permitting and regulatory changes, all of which may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. In addition, the pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient to allow us to achieve our stated targets, goals and ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, executing our Climate Risk Strategy could be costly, is likely to encounter unforeseen obstacles, will proceed at varying paces and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We expect to be required to purchase emission credits and/or offsets in the future. There may be an insufficient supply of offsets, and we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. Even if we are able to acquire an adequate amount of such offsets at satisfactory prices, investors, regulators or other third parties may not perceive this practice as an acceptable means of achieving our emission reduction goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise aspects of our Climate Risk Strategy. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.\n\nIn early 2021, we established a multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization with the remit of supporting our emissions reduction objectives, understanding the alternative energy landscape and prioritizing opportunities for future competitive investment. Such potential investments may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. While we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any, and we may suspend our evaluation or investment i f we determine that applicable markets have not developed at the pace required to support further investment. For example, as a result of the hydrogen and ammonia markets not developing at a pace required to support further investment, in 2024 we decided to suspend our evaluation of a low-carbon ammonia production facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we may not be able to scale potential investments. The success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, the development of relevant markets for low carbon fuels, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, willingness of industry partners to collaborate and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.\n\nEstimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\n\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur i mpairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported $8,610 million in total investments in and advances to affiliates in 2024, with the largest portion ($4,977 million) allocated to the Asia-Pacific region. Chevron applies the equity method for affiliates in which it holds a 20\u201350% ownership stake or exercises significant influence, and it assesses these investments for impairment based on factors like financial performance and recovery potential. ExxonMobil, through its 2003 Incentive Program, extends equity-based compensation to employees of affiliates it owns at least 50% of, aligning affiliate performance with corporate goals through long-term vesting structures. Together, these approaches show that while all three companies maintain significant exposure to affiliates, they manage and integrate these relationships differently\u2014COP through geographic investment allocation, CVX through equity-method accounting and impairment discipline, and XOM through incentive alignment and long-term employee retention strategies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 1\n\n## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nGeneral The  company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Prior years' data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2024 presentation basis.\n\nSubsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated  on  a  proportionate  basis.  Investments  in  and  advances  to  affiliates  in  which  the  company  has  a  substantial  ownership  interest  of  approx imately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method.\n\nInvestments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company's carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial performance, and the company's ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment's market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\n\nDifferences between the company's carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company's analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company's share of the affiliate's reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate's historical book values.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company's subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent's equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.\n\nFair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\nDerivatives The majority of the company's activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company's commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company's fix ed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.\n\nInventories Crude oil, products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. 'Materials, supplies and other' inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value.",

Incentive Program\n\nThe 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and other forms of awards. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Company and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned by the Corporation. Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are forfeited, ex pire, or are settled in cash do not count against this max imum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the ExxonMobil Board of Directors terminates the plan early. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 47 million.\n\nRestricted  Stock  and  Restricted  Stock  U nits. Awards  of  restricted  (nonvested)  common  stock  units  granted  under  the  2003  Incentive  Program  totaled 10,393 thousand, 9,701 thousand, and 9,392 thousand in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities, and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in  each  award vesting after three years,  and  the  remaining 50  percent  vesting  after seven years.  Some management, professional, and technical participants will receive awards that vest in full after three years. Awards granted to a small number of senior ex ecutives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years for the remaining 50 percent of the award, except that for awards granted prior to 2020 the vesting of the 10-year portion of the award is delayed until retirement if later than 10 years.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the merger agreement for the Pioneer acquisition, which closed on May 3, 2024, awards of Pioneer restricted stock units granted under the Pioneer Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan (Pioneer L TIP) that did not vest as of immediately prior to the closing were cancelled and converted into awards of ExxonMobil restricted stock units based on the merger exchange ratio. The grant date for the converted Pioneer awards is considered to be the effective date of the acquisition for the purpose of calculating fair value. Compensation costs for the converted Pioneer awards is recognized in income over a period commensurate with the vesting schedule. Pioneer awards vest in three installments over a period of three years with approximately one third of the awards vesting each year. Shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. The maximum term of the Pioneer awards is three years. As of the Pioneer acquisition closing on May 3, 2024, the maximum number of shares of stock that can be issued under the Pioneer L TIP was 9,458 thousand. At the end of 2024, remaining shares available for awards under the Pioneer LTIP were 9,362 thousand.\n\nThe following tables summarize information about restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) evaluates its deferred tax assets by applying valuation allowances based on positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income and foreign tax impacts. Chevron (CVX) reports $4,852 in unrecognized tax benefits, with 76% potentially affecting its effective tax rate if recognized, and anticipates a 68% reduction in these benefits within 12 months. ExxonMobil (XOM) recognizes uncertain tax benefits based on a 'more likely than not' threshold and measures the benefit at the largest amount with over 50% likelihood of realization. Together, these disclosures highlight differing approaches to quantifying and disclosing tax risk exposure, with CVX providing the most detailed forecast of near-term resolution, while COP emphasizes judgment in assessing future income and valuation allowances, and XOM focuses on recognition criteria and measurement thresholds.",

          "chunk_text": "## Projected Benefit Obligations\n\nThe actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, i ncluding estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $500 million. Benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $70 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. We are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. These benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. In the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. See Note 15 .\n\n## Contingencies\n\nA number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. Management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts and other legal disputes. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure; however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see the 'Contingencies' section within 'Capital Resources and Liquidity' and Note 10 .\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weigh the evidence based on objectivity. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). See Note 16 .\n\nWe regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions i n countries where we operate. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. These accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax  carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\n\nThe company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxation and audits throughout the world. With certain exceptions, income tax examinations are completed through 2016 for the United States and 2007 for other major jurisdictions.\n\nThe company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. Of the amount of unrecognized tax benefits the company has identified as of December 31, 2024, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in decreases of approximately 68 percent within the next 12 months. G iven the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nOn the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income,  the  company  reports  interest  and  penalties  related  to  liabilities  for  uncertain  tax   positions  as  'Income  Tax   Ex pense (Benefit).' As of December 31, 2024, accrued expense of $268 for anticipated interest and penalties was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accrued expense of $229 as of year-end 2023.

          "chunk_text": "## Climate Change\n\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG reduction.  These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:\n\n- European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the EU member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.  Our cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2021 was approximately $19 million (net share before-tax ).\n- U.K. Emissions Trading Scheme, the program with which the U.K. has replaced the ETS.  Our cost of compliance with the U.K. ETS in 2021 was approximately $2.8 million (net share before  -tax).\n- The Alberta Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. The total cost of these regulations in 2021 was approximately $1 million (net share before-tax) .\n- The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirmed that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an 'air pollutant' under the Federal Clean Air Act.\n- The U.S. EPA's  announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as 'Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,'  75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA's  and U.S. Department of Transportation's  joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.\n- The U.S. EPA's  announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas industry.\n- The U.S. government has announced on September 17, 2021 the Global Methane Pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.\n- Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.  Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2021 were fees of approximately $35 million (net share before  -tax).  We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $5.7 million (net share before-tax).\n- The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21 st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, setting out a process for achieving global emission reductions.  The new administration has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced related commitments.  Accordingly, the U.S. administration set a new target on April 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.\n\nIn the U.S., some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions.  Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes,  the restriction of output, investments  of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.  We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.",

Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.\n\nGovernments,  companies,  communities,  and  other  stakeholders  are  increasingly  supporting  efforts  to  address  climate  change, recognizing that individuals and society benefit from access to affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of adoption and implementation. These policies, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement,  can  change  the  amount  of  energy  consumed,  the  rate  of  energy-demand  growth,  the  energy  mix,  and  the  relative economics  of  one  fuel  versus  another.  Implementation  of  these  policies  can  be  dependent  on,  and  can  affect  the  pace  of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon  credits,  the  availability  of  suppliers  that  can  meet  sustainability  and  other  standards,  evolving  regulatory  requirements affecting  ESG  standards  or  other  disclosures,  and  evolving  standards  for  tracking  and  reporting  on  emissions  and  emission reductions and removals. Beyond the legislative and regulatory landscape, ever changing customer and consumer behavior can also influence energy demand by affecting preferences and use of the company's products or competitors' products, now and in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nUnder our Outlook, energy for transportation - including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes - is expected to increase by almost 25 percent from 2019 to 2050. Transportation energy demand is expected to account for over 40 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak by around 2025 and then decline to levels seen in the early-2000s by 2050 as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe, and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about 75 percent. By 2050, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for around 15 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world's  commercial  transportation  fleets  are  expected  to  continue  to  run  on  liquid  fuels,  including  biofuels,  which  are  widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes.\n\nLiquid  fuels  provide  the  largest  share  of  global  energy  supplies  today  reflecting  broad-based  availability,  affordability,  ease  of transportation,  and  fitness  as  a  practical  solution  to  meet  a  wide  variety  of  needs.  By  2050,  global  demand  for  liquid  fuels  is projected to grow to approximately 114 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 14 percent from 2019. The non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to nearly 70 percent by 2050, as liquid fuels demand in the OECD is expected to decline by more than 20 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from traditional conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources - including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels - are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world's resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through 2050 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and lower-carbon supply options. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies.\n\nNatural gas is a lower-emission, versatile and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications, and it is expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from 2019 to 2050, meeting about 55 percent of global energy demand growth. Global natural gas demand is expected to rise nearly 35 percent from 2019 to 2050, with more than half of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas - the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations - will help meet these needs. In total, about 50 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting more than twothirds of worldwide demand in 2050. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about 40 percent of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.\n\nThe world's energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2050. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close to 30 percent in 2050. Coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is expected to lose that position to natural gas in the next few years. The share of natural gas is expected to reach more than 25 percent by 2050, while the share of coal falls to about half that of natural gas. Nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total renewable energy is expected to exceed 20 percent of global energy by 2050, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a combined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing over 420 percent from 2019 to 2050, when they are projected to be about 10 percent of the world energy mix.\n\nTo meet this projected demand under our Outlook, the Corporation anticipates that the world's available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The investments to develop and supply resources to meet global demand through 2050 will be significant. This reflects a fundamental aspect of the oil and natural gas business as the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes in its World Energy Outlook 2021.\n\nInternational accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into account  policies  established  to  reduce  energy-related  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  its  long-term  Energy  Outlook.  The  climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. Our  Energy  Outlook  reflects  an  environment  with  increasingly  stringent  climate  policies  and  is  consistent  with  the  global aggregation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as available at the end of 2020, which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Energy Outlook seeks to identify  potential  impacts  of  climate-related  policies,  which  often  target  specific  sectors.  It  estimates  potential  impacts  of  these policies  on  consumer  energy  demand  by  using  various  assumptions  and  tools  -  including,  depending  on  the  sector,  and,  as applicable, use of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive fuel economy standards). For purposes of the Energy Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO2 emissions is assumed to reach about $100 per metric ton in 2050 in OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives. Nevertheless, as people and  nations  look  for  ways  to  reduce  risks  of  global  climate  change,  they  will  continue  to  need  practical  solutions  that  do  not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The Corporation continues to monitor the updates to the NDCs that  nations  provided  around  COP  26  in  Glasgow  in  November  2021  as  well  as  other  policy  developments  in  light  of  net-zero ambitions recently formulated by some nations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas\n\nChevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron's 2021 key upstream activities,  some  of  which  are  also  discussed  in  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of Operations,  beginning  on  page  38,  are  presented  below.  The  comments  include  references  to  'total  production'  and  'net production,' which are defined under 'Production' in Exhibit 99.1.\n\nThe  discussion  that  follows  references  the  status  of  proved  reserves  recognition  for  significant  long-lead-time  projects  not  on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries  that  have  not  advanced  to  a  project  stage,  or  for  mature  areas  of  production  that  do  not  have  individual  projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.\n\n## United States\n\nUpstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 8. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 7.\n\nChevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with a production outlook of more than one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The company's advantaged portfolio of development areas in west Texas and southeast New Mexico is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations. Chevron has implemented a Permian factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. Top tier drilling and completions performance has enabled year-over-year capital expenditure efficiency improvement and cycle time reduction generating higher returns throughout Chevron's Permian portfolio. Chevron's Permian operations have also demonstrated continual progress on its lower carbon and water  goals,  consistently  ranking  among  the  best  Permian  operators  for  methane  emissions  intensity,  routine  flaring,  and  water handling (utilizing 99 percent brackish or recycled sources). In 2021, Chevron's net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin  averaged  284,000  barrels  of  crude  oil,  1.1  billion  cubic  feet  of  natural  gas  and  148,000  barrels  of  NGLs.  Conventional production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil, 39 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs per day.\n\nChevron holds mature assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas that produced 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2021.\n\nIn  2021,  Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 96,000 barrels.  Chevron  completed  front-end  engineering  and  design  (FEED)  in  second  quarter  2021  on  a  carbon  capture  project  for emissions reduction from the gas turbines in one of our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies-carbon dioxide concentration and carbon capture-and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. A final  investment  decision  for  this  project  is  expected  in  third  quarter  2022,  with  anticipated  start-up  in  2024.  Chevron  is  also progressing  the  installation  of  a  20MWh  battery  at  the  solar  power  plant  in  the  Lost  Hills  field  with  start-up  expected  in  third quarter 2022.\n\nIn Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron's Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the company's comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. Chevron's net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged 56,000 barrels of crude oil, 302 million cubic feet of natural gas and 36,000 barrels of NGLs during 2021.\n\nChevron also has operations in Colorado's Piceance Basin as well as acreage positions in Wyoming and Utah.\n\nDuring 2021, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 180,000 barrels of crude oil, 102 million cubic feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields.\n\nThe deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Additional development opportunities for the Jack and St. Malo fields progressed in 2021. The St. Malo Stage 4 waterflood project includes two new production wells, three injector wells, and topsides water injection equipment at the St. Malo Field. Two oil production wells were placed online, and first injection is expected in 2023. Additional Jack development in 2021 consisted",

Throughout the document, certain totals and percentages may not sum to their component parts due to rounding.\n\n## Business Environment and Outlook\n\nChevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Canada,  China,  Egypt,  Equatorial  G uinea,  Israel,  Kazakhstan,  Mex ico,  Nigeria,  the  Partitioned  Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela.\n\nThe company's objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company's control. In the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the  company  to  adjust  operating  ex penses,  including  employee  reductions,  and  capital  ex penditures,  along  with  other  measures  intended  to  improve  financial performance.\n\nSome governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG  emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG  standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals.\n\nSome of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

Chevron reported that its 2023 extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins totaled 173 million BOE, and it spent approximately $5.0 billion in the U.S., including development activities in the Midland Basin. ExxonMobil is acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources, which holds over 850 thousand net acres and 2.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels of proved reserves in the Midland Basin, in a $65 billion transaction. This indicates that all three companies view the Midland Basin as a core asset, but with differing approaches: COP focuses on ongoing development within a broader capital allocation strategy, CVX emphasizes reserve additions and production growth, and XOM is making a transformative acquisition to significantly expand its position.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights that commodity price volatility significantly affects revenues and operating results, with WTI crude oil prices fluctuating between $67 and $94 per barrel in 2023, influencing strategic decisions around capital investment and production levels. Chevron notes that it is primarily in a commodities business with a history of price volatility, emphasizing that crude oil prices are the most significant factor affecting its results, influenced by economic growth, production levels, and geopolitical risks. ExxonMobil warns that policy actions aimed at reducing hydrocarbon use without addressing demand could lead to increased commodity price volatility, with potential inflationary pressures and energy shortages. Collectively, these perspectives show that while all three companies are exposed to commodity price volatility, they differ in how they frame the risk\u2014COP focuses on operational flexibility and reserve replacement, CVX emphasizes market dynamics and energy transition, and XOM highlights regulatory and policy-driven volatility.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) highlights that new or more stringent hydraulic fracturing regulations could result in increased costs, operational restrictions, or delays, and notes exposure through potential methane emission charges under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Chevron (CVX) embeds the evolving regulatory landscape around hydraulic fracturing into its long-range planning and forecasts, with $2.5 billion in 2023 environmental expenditures, though it does not isolate costs specific to fracturing. ExxonMobil (XOM) emphasizes that regulatory changes targeting hydraulic fracturing could reduce or delay business opportunities and increase compliance costs, posing a material risk to operations and strategy execution. Together, these perspectives suggest that while all three companies face exposure to fracturing regulations, their risk disclosures vary in specificity and framing, with COP focusing on direct cost impacts, CVX integrating regulatory shifts into strategic planning, and XOM emphasizing strategic and opportunity risks.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations: ConocoPhillips explicitly states that hydraulic fracturing faces political and regulatory scrutiny and that new or more stringent requirements could increase costs, restrict operations, or delay projects.

It spent $2.5 billion on environmental matters in 2023, though it does not isolate fracturing-specific costs, indicating a broader risk management approach.",
        "Hop 3: XOM \u2192 Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations: ExxonMobil warns that regulatory changes targeting hydraulic fracturing could reduce or delay business opportunities and increase compliance costs, directly linking these risks to strategic execution and operational flexibility."

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights Permian Basin extensions and discoveries as a key component of reserve additions, specifically citing unconventional plays as a source of growth. Chevron reports a 7% increase in worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2024, with the Permian Basin identified as a primary growth driver alongside the full-year contribution from the PDC Energy acquisition. ExxonMobil explicitly states that Permian production averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2024, a 570 thousand increase from the prior year, and plans to roughly double production to 2.3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2030, supported by the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and the deployment of proprietary drilling technologies. Together, these disclosures indicate that while all three companies are prioritizing Permian Basin growth, ExxonMobil is pursuing the most aggressive production expansion, Chevron is leveraging acquisitions for steady growth, and ConocoPhillips is emphasizing reserve additions through exploration and development drilling.",

          "chunk_text": "Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:\n\n- Revisions : In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 298 million barrels and technical revisions of 28 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 114 million barrels for changes in development plans, 23 million barrels due to lower prices and increasing operating costs of 4 million barrels. An upward revision of 52 million barrels in Africa was due to an increase in development plans in Libya. In the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East, upward revisions of 15 million barrels were primarily due to the project sanction of Bohai Bay Phase 5 in China. Upward revisions of 5 million barrels in Canada were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached later than previously premised, resulting in upward revisions of 22 million barrels. Further upward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 8 million barrels. These were partially offset by downward revisions due to increasing operating costs of 15 million barrels and 10 million barrels due to technical revisions. Downward revisions in Europe were due to technical revisions of 3 million barrels and development plan changes of 2 million barrels.\n- In 2023, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to development drilling of 161 million barrels and technical revisions in the unconventional plays of 31 million barrels, partially offset by downward revisions of 52 million barrels due to lower prices and 14 million barrels for changes in development plans. An upward revision of 10 million barrels in Africa was primarily development drilling in Libya. Upward revisions of 8 million barrels in the consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were due to technical revisions. In Alaska, where future production is constrained by the TransAlaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, updated total North Slope development phasing indicated that the flow limit will be reached earlier than previously premised, resulting in downward revisions of 25 million barrels. Further downward revisions in Alaska include development plan changes of 14 million barrels, cost escalation of 13 million barrels, and 7 million barrels due to lower prices, partially offset by 2 million barrels of technical revisions.\n\nIn 2022, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to additional development drilling in the unconventional plays of 81 million barrels and higher prices of 33 million barrels, partially offset by increasing operating costs of 72 million barrels and technical revisions of 18 million barrels. Upward revisions in Europe were primarily due to technical revisions of 23 million barrels and 8 million barrels due to higher prices. Upward revisions of 19 million barrels in our consolidated operations in Asia Pacific/Middle East were primarily due to technical revisions.\n\n- Purchases : In 2024, our acquisition of Marathon Oil resulted in purchases for Lower 48, as well as for Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea. Purchases in Alaska represent the acquisition of additional interest in the Kuparuk River and Prudhoe Bay units.\n\nIn 2022, crude oil reserve purchases were primarily in Africa, as a result of the acquisition of additional interest in the Libya Waha Concession.\n\n- Extensions and discoveries : In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Alaska extensions and discoveries were primarily due to Nuna and other Western North Slope projects. Extensions and discoveries in Canada were in Montney. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n- In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Alaska were driven primarily by the Willow and Nuna projects. Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in Canada and Asia Pacific/Middle East were driven primarily by Montney and Bohai Phase 4B in China, respectively.\n\nIn 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n140",

Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3.3 million barrels per day in 2024 was up approximately seven percent from 2023, mainly due to the full-year of legacy  PDC  Energy,  Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nEnergy for transportation - including cars, trucks, ships, trains, and airplanes - is ex pected to increase by about 25 percent from 2023 to 2050. Transportation energy demand is expected to account for about 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak by around 2025, and then decline to levels seen in the early-2000s by 2050, as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe, and the United States, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of approximately 65 percent. By 2050, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for around 20 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world's commercial transportation fleets are expected to continue to run on liquid fuels, including biofuels, which are expected to be widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of energy in small volumes.\n\nAlmost half of the world's energy use is dedicated to industrial activity. As the global middle class continues to grow, demand for durable products, appliances, and consumable goods will increase. Industry uses energy products both as a fuel and as a feedstock for chemicals, asphalt, lubricants, waxes, and other specialty products. The Outlook anticipates technology advances, as well as the increasing shift toward cleaner forms of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, with coal declining. Demand for oil will continue to grow as a feedstock for industry.\n\nAs populations grow and prosperity rises, more energy will be needed to power homes, offices, schools, shopping centers, hospitals, etc. Combined residential and commercial  energy  demand  is  projected  to  rise  by  around  15  percent  through  2050.  Led  by  the  growing  economies  of  developing  nations,  average  worldwide household electricity use is expected to rise more than 65 percent between 2023 and 2050.\n\nLiquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of transportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2050, global demand for liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 110 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of about 10 percent from 2023. The non-OECD share of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to nearly 70 percent by 2050, as liquid fuels demand in the OECD is expected to decline by more than 25 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from conventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of supply sources - including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids, and biofuels - are ex pected to grow to help meet rising demand. Timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies.\n\nNatural gas is a lower-emission, versatile, and practical fuel for a wide variety of applications. G lobal natural gas demand is ex pected to rise more than 20 percent from 2023 to 2050, with approximately 75 percent of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas - the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations - will help meet these needs. In total, about 35 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to come from unconventional sources. At the same time, conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting around two-thirds of worldwide demand in 2050. LNG trade will expand significantly, meeting about 70 percent of the increase in global demand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) applies the unit-of-production method to its proved oil and gas properties, plants, and equipment (PP&E), which had a net book value of $52 billion as of December 31, 2021. DD&A expense for the year was $7.0 billion, and the method relies on proved oil and gas reserves estimated by internal reservoir engineers, with inputs such as price assumptions, operating costs, and tax rates. Chevron (CVX) also uses the unit-of-production method for depreciation and depletion of upstream assets, with a net PP&E balance of $130.8 billion and DD&A expense of $16.5 billion for the same period. CVX\u2019s reserves estimation involves asset teams and a Reserves Advisory Committee, with variables including commodity prices, field performance, and carbon costs. ExxonMobil (XOM) applies the unit-of-production method to amortize acquisition costs of proved properties based on total proved oil and gas reserve volumes and uses it for capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs based on proved developed reserves. XOM also notes that in limited cases where the unit-of-production method does not equitably allocate cost over the asset\u2019s life, it uses the straight-line method. This reveals that while all three use the same core method, their approaches to reserve estimation, internal controls, and asset life assumptions differ, reflecting variations in operational complexity, asset maturity, and internal governance structures.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\n## Accounting for asset retirement obligations for certain offshore properties\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $5.9 billion. As further described in Note 8, the Company records AROs in the period in which they are incurred, typically when the asset is installed  at the production location. The estimation  of obligations related to certain offshore assets requires  significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty related to plugging and abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms, facilities and pipelines costs (collectively, removal costs). Furthermore, given certain of these assets are nearing the end of their operations, the impact of changes in these AROs may result in a material impact to earnings given the relatively short remainin  g useful lives of the assets.\n\nAuditing the Company's AROs for the obligations identified above is complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligations. In particular,  the estimates were sensitive to  significant subjective assumptions such as removal cost estimates and end of field life, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management's review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. We also tested management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in the valuation.\n\nTo test  the AROs for the obligations identified above, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, including removal cost estimates and end of field life assumptions. For example, we evaluated removal cost estimates by comparing to settlements and recent removal activities and costs. We also compared end of field life assumptions to production forecasts.\n\n## Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the net book value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment (PP&amp;E) was $52 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) expense was $7.0 billion for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&amp;A of PP&amp;E on producing hydrocarbon properties and steam-assisted gravity drainage facilities and certain pipeline and liquified natural gas assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined by the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production method uses proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company's internal reservoir engineers.\n\nProved oil and gas reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. Significant judgment is required by the Company's internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved oil and gas reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating proved oil and gas reserves, management also used an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm to perform a review of the processes and controls used by the Company's internal reservoir engineers to determine estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.",

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nThe Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  18  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company's  upstream  property,  plant  and equipment, net balance was $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  properties,  except  mineral  interests,  are  expensed  using  the  unit-of-production  method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral  interests  are  recognized  using  the  unit-of-production  method  by  individual  field  as  the  related  proved  reserves  are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company's earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as 'management's specialists').\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management's specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to management's estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management's specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for  using  this  work,  the  specialists'  qualifications  were  understood  and  the  Company's  relationship  with  the  specialists  was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists' findings.\n\n.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Francisco, California February 24, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1935.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

CVX discloses both U.S. and international NGL production, with U.S. sales at 201 thousand barrels/day and international sales at 84 thousand barrels/day in 2022, indicating a more balanced geographic footprint. XOM, however, only mentions NGL in the title of a section on proved reserves without disclosing specific production volumes, suggesting a less transparent or less emphasized position in the NGL market. This contrast shows that COP and CVX are more explicit about their NGL production and strategic relevance, while XOM's opaque disclosure may signal a lesser focus or integration of NGL within its upstream portfolio.",

      "answer": "COP applies the successful efforts method by using the unit-of-production method for DD&A, relying heavily on proved oil and gas reserves estimated by internal reservoir engineers, with a DD&A expense of $9.4 billion for 2024. CVX integrates the successful efforts method into its broader impairment framework, emphasizing sensitivity to assumptions like future commodity prices and production profiles when assessing asset recoverability. XOM applies the method by capitalizing costs on a field-by-field basis, distinguishing between exploratory and development costs, and capitalizing interest during multiyear project construction phases. The filings show that while all three companies follow the same accounting policy, their specific applications and disclosures around reserves estimation, impairment triggers, and cost capitalization vary, highlighting inconsistencies in how financial reporting is operationalized across the upstream energy sector.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the net book value of the Company's proved oil and gas properties, plants and equipment (PP&amp;E) was $77 billion, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&amp;A) expense was $9.4 billion for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&amp;A of PP&amp;E on producing hydrocarbon properties and steamassisted gravity drainage facilities and certain pipeline and liquified natural gas assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization pattern) are determined by the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production method uses proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company's internal reservoir engineers.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. Significant judgment is required by the Company's internal reservoir engineers in evaluating the data used to estimate proved oil and gas reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including historical production, oil and gas price assumptions and future operating costs assumptions, among others.\n\nAuditing the Company's DD&amp;A calculation is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its processes to calculate DD&amp;A, including management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of significant data provided to the internal reservoir engineers for use in estimating proved oil and gas reserves.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's i nternal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the proved oil and gas reserves estimates. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs described above used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. We also tested the accuracy of the DD&amp;A calculation, including comparing the proved oil and gas reserves amounts used in the calculation to the Company's reserve report.",

If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\n\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company's business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company's crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets' associated carrying values.\n\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company's carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable,  given  the  broad  range  of  the  company's  PP&amp;E  and  the  number  of  assumptions  involved  in  the  estimates.  That  is,  favorable  changes  to  some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company's long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates.  That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\n\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company's pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe Corporation excludes from the  Consolidated  Statement of  Income certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates that arise from existing assets, liabilities, firm commitments, and forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative. All gains and losses from derivative instruments for which the Corporation does not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2, and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil, products, and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method LIFO).  Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant, and E quipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nInterest costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.",

      "question": "How do COP, CVX, and XOM differ in their quantitative exposure to natural gas reserves and production, and what does this reveal about their relative positioning in the context of long-term energy transition strategies?",
      "answer": "COP reported 4,910 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gross gas reserves and 2,975 Bcf of net reserves in 2024, with significant production in the Lower 48 and Asia Pacific/Middle East via equity affiliates. CVX reported 20,954 Bcf of total gas reserves (both consolidated and affiliated), with major positions in Asia and Australia, showing a much larger scale of gas exposure. XOM, while not disclosing specific gas reserve figures, emphasized a strategic shift toward lower-emissions energy solutions, indicating a more cautious approach to gas dependency. This contrast suggests COP maintains a moderate but growing gas footprint, CVX remains heavily invested in gas as a core component of its portfolio, and XOM is strategically reducing reliance on gas in favor of energy transition-aligned assets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Gas: COP's 2024 reserves include 4,910 Bcf of gross gas and 2,975 Bcf net reserves, with 2,782 Bcf net production in the Lower 48 and 1,615 Bcf equity affiliate production in Asia Pacific/Middle East, indicating a significant but not dominant gas focus.",
        "Hop 2: CVX \u2192 Gas: CVX reported 20,954 Bcf in total natural gas reserves (consolidated and affiliated), with major reserves in Asia (6,974 Bcf) and Australia (6,951 Bcf), showing a much larger and more globally diversified gas position.",
        "Hop 3: XOM \u2192 Gas: XOM's 2024 filing indicates a strategic pivot toward lower-emissions energy, implying a reduced emphasis on gas despite its current role in the portfolio, though no specific gas reserve figures are provided."

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and ExxonMobil each describe the impact of regulatory and permitting delays on their capital project timelines, and what does this suggest about the variability of execution risk across their upstream portfolios?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips highlights that delays associated with the permitting process, including notice and comment periods, are often beyond the applicant's control and can significantly affect project timelines. Chevron notes in its cautionary statements that potential delays in the development, construction, or start-up of planned projects are among the key risks impacting its operations. ExxonMobil specifically links project implementation delays to government actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as restrictive permitting and regulatory hurdles. Taken together, these disclosures suggest that while all three companies face execution risk from regulatory delays, the nature and framing of those risks vary: ConocoPhillips emphasizes procedural delays in environmental permitting, Chevron highlights systemic risks across its global portfolio, and ExxonMobil ties delays directly to climate-related policy actions, indicating differing exposures depending on regional regulatory environments and project types.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Project Delays: ConocoPhillips explicitly states that permitting delays, including notice and comment periods, are often beyond the applicant's control and can be expensive and time-consuming, directly affecting project timelines.",
        "Hop 2: CVX \u2192 Project Delays: Chevron includes 'potential delays in the development, construction, or start-up of planned projects' among its key forward-looking risks, indicating a broad exposure to execution risk across its global operations.",
        "Hop 3: XOM \u2192 Project Delays: ExxonMobil links delays in project implementation to government actions targeting greenhouse gas emissions, such as restrictive permitting, suggesting a growing intersection between climate policy and operational execution risk."

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), and ExxonMobil (XOM) each quantify their exposure to crude oil through reserves, production, and downstream integration, and what does this reveal about their differing strategic positioning in the upstream and downstream energy markets?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) emphasizes upstream production and reserves growth, as seen in its 2023 10-K, indicating a strategy focused on resource expansion and operational efficiency in crude oil extraction. Chevron (CVX) provides detailed reserve data showing a consistent increase in crude oil reserves through discoveries and purchases, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, reflecting a diversified upstream portfolio. ExxonMobil (XOM) highlights crude oil purchases totaling $79 million in 2023, significantly lower than its sales revenue of $986 million, suggesting a downstream monetization strategy where crude is sourced and refined for higher-margin products. Together, these data points indicate COP\u2019s upstream-centric approach, CVX\u2019s balanced upstream portfolio, and XOM\u2019s downstream value capture through crude oil processing and sales.",

        "Hop 3: XOM \u2192 Crude Oil: XOM's 2023 10-K reports $79 million in crude oil and product purchases versus $986 million in sales revenue, suggesting downstream integration and value-added processing."
