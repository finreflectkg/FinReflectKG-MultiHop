          "chunk_text": "## PART I\n\n## Item 1\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of highquality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

          "chunk_text": "## Segment Reporting\n\nThe  Company  reports  segment  information  based  on  the  'management'  approach.  The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

      "answer": "AMD reported $1,841 million in sales to external customers from Taiwan in 2023, indicating a notable but declining revenue exposure compared to previous years. Meanwhile, QCOM explicitly states that its business depends on consistent and reliable chipset supply from foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan. A significant or prolonged military or geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent QCOM from receiving chipset supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. Given that both companies are exposed to Taiwan\u2014AMD through revenue and QCOM through critical supply chain dependencies\u2014geopolitical instability in the region poses a dual risk, impacting both revenue streams and manufacturing continuity.",

      "question": "How might geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan impact both QCOM's chipset supply and NVDA's supply continuity, given their reliance on foundry partners operating in the region?",
      "answer": "QCOM's business depends on receiving consistent chipset supply from foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan, and a significant geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan could severely limit or prevent QCOM from receiving this supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. Similarly, NVDA notes that geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China, where it has critical suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners, could have a material adverse impact on its supply continuity. Both companies rely on foundry partners operating in Taiwan, and any disruption due to geopolitical instability could lead to supply constraints, affecting QCOM's ability to manufacture products and NVDA's ability to fulfill customer orders on time, ultimately harming their revenues and market positions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 Foundry Partners: QCOM relies on foundry partners in Taiwan for consistent chipset supply, and any disruption could severely impact its business.",
        "Hop 2: Foundry Partners \u2192 Taiwan: The foundry partners that supply QCOM are primarily located in and operate from Taiwan, making them vulnerable to geopolitical tensions in the region.",
        "Hop 3: Taiwan \u2190 NVDA: NVDA explicitly states that geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China could materially impact its supply chain, as it depends on suppliers and manufacturing partners in the region for continuity."

      "question": "How might the reliance of CRM's Agentforce for Sales and Service on AI technology be affected by evolving AI regulations, and how does this regulatory exposure compare to IBM's exposure given its global operations in over 175 countries?",
      "answer": "CRM's Agentforce for Sales and Service depend heavily on AI technology to automate tasks, improve productivity, and deliver personalized customer experiences. However, evolving AI regulations\u2014specifically highlighted in the GS_10k_2024.pdf\u2014pose compliance risks due to the uncertain and rapidly changing legal environment around AI, including requirements for transparency, data governance, and intellectual property considerations. These regulations could force CRM to modify its AI implementations, increasing compliance costs. Similarly, IBM, which operates in over 175 countries, faces significant exposure to AI regulations globally. The IBM_10k_2024.pdf notes that IBM could be directly or indirectly impacted by the development and enforcement of AI-specific laws, especially as it expands its AI-driven offerings. Given CRM's deep integration of AI in customer-facing platforms and IBM's global regulatory exposure, both companies must navigate increasingly complex compliance landscapes, though IBM\u2019s broader geographic footprint likely amplifies its regulatory risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

      "answer": "INTE (Intel) reported that 27% of its total revenue in FY2021 came from billings to China, and U.S. export restrictions targeting Chinese technology companies have already reduced its sales, with potential for further adverse effects. These restrictions are part of broader U.S. export control regulations that also directly apply to QCOM, as it is subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. QCOM acknowledges that evolving interpretations and enforcement of these export control regulations could negatively impact its business operations and financial results, particularly given its significant exposure to the Chinese market. Therefore, both companies face similar regulatory constraints, but the financial impact on INTC may be more immediately visible due to its quantified China revenue exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## We operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions.\n\nGlobal or regional conditions can harm our financial results. We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\n\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\nWe can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:\n\n- geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;\n- natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other catastrophic events;\n- inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n- formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;\n- government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n- adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;\n- differing employment practices and labor issues;\n- ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n- local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n- continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and\n- fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new US dollar LIBOR-based activity should be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.\n\nIn particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n57",

Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as: volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees, including any announcement concerning the initiation of, or any developments in, any lawsuit or governmental investigation or proceeding against us; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management's attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\n## Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.\n\nOur business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others, Regulations related to: patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; imports and exports, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; privacy and data protection; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure; automotive industry safety and quality standards; and business conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled ' Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,' ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,' 'A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,' ' There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,' and 'Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.'\n\nRegulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## There are risks associated with our debt.\n\nOur outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\n\n## Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in",

In contrast, AVGO holds $56.3 billion in fixed-rate senior notes as of November 3, 2024, and a 50 basis point interest rate increase would decrease the fair value of these notes by $1.7 billion. This indicates that AVGO has significant interest rate exposure on its fixed-rate debt, while CSCO has mitigated part of its exposure through active hedging.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CSCO \u2192 Interest Rate Swap: CSCO holds a $0.5 billion interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge on certain fixed-rate senior notes, converting the fixed interest rate to a floating rate based on SOFR.",
        "Hop 2: Interest Rate Swap \u2192 Fixed Rate Senior Notes: The interest rate swap directly hedges the fair value of CSCO\u2019s fixed-rate senior notes against changes in market interest rates.",
        "Hop 3: Fixed Rate Senior Notes \u2190 AVGO: AVGO has $56.3 billion in fixed-rate senior notes outstanding as of November 3, 2024, with a 50 basis point interest rate change affecting their fair value by $1.7 billion, indicating significant interest rate sensitivity without mention of similar hedging activity."

Broadcom director Diane M. Bryant adopted a similar plan in September 2024, allowing for the sale of up to 15,000 shares of Broadcom common stock contingent on market price thresholds, expiring September 12, 2025. Both companies utilize Rule 10b5-1(c) plans to structure insider trading in compliance with SEC regulations, but Apple\u2019s plans involve significantly larger volumes and longer time horizons.",

      "answer": "Microsoft acknowledges exposure to the Global Minimum Tax as part of OECD's Pillar Two framework, which introduces a 15% minimum tax rate intended to apply globally. Microsoft notes uncertainty around implementation but recognizes the potential for increased tax liabilities depending on legislative developments. In contrast, Intel reports that a higher proportion of its income is taxed in non-US jurisdictions, which contributed to a lower effective tax rate. Intel is actively evaluating the impact of Pillar Two, especially as several jurisdictions, including EU Member States, begin adopting components of the framework starting in 2024. While Microsoft expresses concern over increased compliance costs and potential tax liabilities, Intel suggests that its current geographic income distribution may mitigate the impact of the minimum tax, though full effects remain uncertain due to evolving global legislation.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "question": "How might potential Events of Default under shared credit facility terms differently impact Oracle's and Salesforce's debt servicing costs, given their respective credit rating-based interest rate structures and current compliance statuses?",
      "answer": "Oracle's Revolving Credit Agreement ties interest rates to credit ratings, with SOFR-based margins ranging from 87.5 to 150.0 basis points, and as of May 31, 2024, Oracle was in compliance with all debt-related covenants. Salesforce's Revolving Credit Agreement similarly bases interest on credit ratings, with SOFR margins between 0.575% and 1.20%, and as of December 30, 2023, Salesforce was also in compliance with its covenants. If either company experiences an Event of Default, particularly tied to credit rating downgrades, their borrowing costs could increase significantly under these terms, affecting their debt servicing expenses differently depending on the severity of the rating change and current market interest rates.",

        "Hop 2: Revolving Credit Agreement \u2192 Events of Default: Both Oracle and Salesforce have credit facilities containing Events of Default provisions tied to covenant compliance and credit ratings, with interest rate margins that adjust based on those ratings.",

      "question": "How do AMD's ordering and shipment uncertainties compare to Qualcomm's demand forecasting challenges in terms of inventory risk and revenue impact, especially considering AMD's Client and Embedded segment declines and Qualcomm's supplier capacity constraints?",
      "answer": "AMD faces ordering and shipment uncertainties due to reliance on customer demand forecasts, particularly in its Client and Embedded segments, which saw revenue declines in 2022 and 2023 due to PC market contraction and inventory corrections. These uncertainties led to excess or obsolete inventory, including charges in Q3 2022 for inventory, pricing, and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. AMD\u2019s forecasting challenges are compounded when products are sold indirectly, as forecasts depend on estimates from multiple parties in the downstream channel. Similarly, Qualcomm notes that demand forecasting is complicated by supplier capacity constraints and customer overestimation of demand, which can lead to inventory overruns or reserve charges. Qualcomm places orders with suppliers based on forecasts that are only partially covered by customer commitments, increasing the risk of excess or obsolete inventory if demand does not materialize as expected. Both companies face significant inventory and revenue risks stemming from forecasting inaccuracies, though AMD\u2019s challenges are more channel-distribution driven, while Qualcomm\u2019s stem from supplier dynamics and customer overordering.",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's valuation of VMware Cloud Foundation's technology translate into performance optimization capabilities that differentiate its approach compared to Oracle's Autonomous Database optimization strategy?",
      "answer": "Broadcom valued VMware's developed technology, including components related to VMware Cloud Foundation, using the multi-period excess earnings method, reflecting the present value of projected cash flows expected to be generated by the technology. This valuation supports VCF's capabilities, such as native Kubernetes for hybrid workloads, integrated data services, and enterprise-scale AI/ML, which enable customers to continuously optimize performance and costs. In contrast, Oracle focuses on performance optimization through its Autonomous Database, an OCI offering that uses machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce operational complexity. The distinction lies in Broadcom's emphasis on infrastructure-level optimization across hybrid environments versus Oracle's database-centric automation and cloud integration strategy.",

The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Informatica, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments.\n\n## Consulting:\n\nConsulting has simplified our focus to center on strategy, experience, technology and operations to make our huge range of capabilities easier for clients to navigate. Today, Consulting competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. We compete with broad-based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.\n\n## Infrastructure:\n\nIBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions for clients' mission-critical and regulated workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of support services and solutions for hybrid cloud infrastructure. Our principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel and original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Further, as-a-Service providers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and regulated workloads.\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM client's acquisition of IT systems, software and services. Financing's ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'expects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 10 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs.

      "answer": "AVGO competes in the infrastructure software market by emphasizing platform and hardware independence, allowing its enterprise management tools to function across diverse environments. This contrasts with QCOM's approach, where it develops operating systems and system-level technologies that are tightly integrated with its own 3G/4G/5G and RFFE semiconductor architectures. Microsoft plays a pivotal role in enabling software compatibility for x86-based systems, which AMD (and by extension, AVGO's competitors) relies on\u2014Microsoft must design its operating systems to support x86 instruction sets and graphics technologies, influencing how third-party software is developed. QCOM, however, maintains control over both the operating system and the underlying wireless hardware, enabling a more vertically integrated solution optimized for mobile and IoT applications.",

(f/k/a Cree, Inc.), GlobalFoundries Inc., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., iC-Haus GmbH, Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MaxLinear, Inc., Marvell Technology, Inc., MediaTek Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, OSRAM Licht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Skyworks Solutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics Incorporated, TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc. and II-VI Incorporated. We compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration, proprietary materials processes, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for quality products, and our customer relationships.\n\nIn the infrastructure software market, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on specific markets. Our primary competitors are Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BMC Software Inc., BeyondTrust Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint Technologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Splunk, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow",

          "chunk_text": "## We  depend  on  third-party  companies  for  the  design,  manufacture  and  supply  of  motherboards,  software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business.\n\nWe  depend  on  third-party  companies  for  the  design,  manufacture  and  supply  of  motherboards,  graphics  cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

          "chunk_text": "company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/or OFDMAbased technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

      "answer": "A significant geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan could severely limit or prevent Qualcomm from receiving chipset supply from its foundry partners located in Taiwan, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. Similarly, Apple relies on manufacturing partners in Taiwan for a significant portion of its supply chain operations, and any disruption in Taiwan could make it difficult or impossible for Apple to manufacture and deliver products to its customers. This shared dependency on Taiwanese manufacturing creates a synchronized vulnerability where both companies could face simultaneous operational disruptions.",

In contrast, CRM has structural provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws that actively discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control, without triggering automatic financial obligations.

      "answer": "Intel reported $1,595 million in reverse repurchase agreements as of December 25, 2021, which are a subset of U.S. government securities as defined under Level 2 fair value hierarchy. Microsoft, on the other hand, held $90,664 million in U.S. government securities at June 30, 2021, categorized under Level 1 fair value, indicating a significantly larger and more liquid exposure. The classification difference (Level 2 vs. Level 1) suggests Intel's reverse repurchase agreements may carry more valuation complexity or market sensitivity compared to Microsoft's broader holdings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC \u2192 Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Intel disclosed $1,595 million in reverse repurchase agreements as of December 25, 2021, indicating a specific short-term financial instrument used for liquidity management.",
        "Hop 2: Reverse Repurchase Agreements \u2192 U.S. Government Securities: The evidence confirms that reverse repurchase agreements fall under the broader category of U.S. government securities, specifically within the Level 2 fair value hierarchy.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Government Securities \u2190 MSFT: Microsoft held $90,664 million in U.S. government securities as of June 30, 2021, classified under Level 1, showing a much larger and more directly market-valued exposure than Intel\u2019s Level 2 classification."

Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

          "chunk_text": "We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

      "answer": "Microsoft expresses concern that evolving data localization laws, including those in Saudi Arabia, could increase the cost and complexity of delivering its cloud-based services, requiring substantial engineering efforts and potentially limiting its ability to innovate or offer certain features. Saudi Arabia is explicitly mentioned as one of the jurisdictions implementing data localization requirements, which mandate that data be stored and processed within the country. Adobe operates in Saudi Arabia and acknowledges that if the country implements more restrictive data transfer regulations or enforces strict data localization, it could adversely impact Adobe's business operations, financial condition, and results of operations in that jurisdiction. Therefore, both companies face similar regulatory risks tied to Saudi Arabia's data sovereignty policies, which could lead to increased compliance costs and operational constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and inv estment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and serv ices to, or making inv estments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for gov ernment rev iew of transactions inv olv ing information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adv ersaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the av ailability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly ev olv ing sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned indiv iduals and countries, and (2) negativ e impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of rev enue, increased costs, loss of export priv ileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based serv ices internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolv e. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Priv acy Framework ('DPF') has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities hav e and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based serv ices that inv olv e the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of deliv ering our products and serv ices. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which applies to all of our activ ities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and serv ices offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been dev eloping new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Serv ices Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and serv ices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws inv olv e substantial expense and the div ersion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractiv e. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, priv ate lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR hav e recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies, and European data protection authorities hav e taken action to block or remov e serv ices from their markets.

For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely in that country or by only domesEc companies.

We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their l oca l  s a ncEons  obliga Eons  a nd U.S. a nd EU s a ncEons  progra ms.  In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List). Iran and  Syria have been idenEfied by the  U.S.  State  Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated enEEes located in these countries and do not license enEEes domiciled there.

AddiEonally, regulaEons such as the EU's Payment Services DirecEve in the EEA require financial insEtuEons to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transacEons away from Mastercard products and provide payment iniEaEon and account informaEon services directly to consumers who use our products.  AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

Wi th  res pect  to i nformaEon  security,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S.  SecuriEes  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  'SEC')  disclosure  rules  that  require,  among  other  things,  disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

In addition, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.\n\nWe have not prevailed, and may not in the future prevail, in every lawsuit or dispute. For further information about specific litigation and proceedings, see the section titled 'Legal Proceedings' contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.\n\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These local, state, federal and international laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade laws such as import and export controls, anti-boycott, economic sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, consumer protection, records management, usergenerated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, AI regulations, corporate governance, antitrust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and evolving, and may at times conflict. Further, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which may conflict with local customs and practices in other foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies where it is common to engage in practices that would be prohibited under such laws. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, business partners and vendors will not take actions in violation of our internal policies, U.S. laws or other applicable international laws. Compliance with the above laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require additional changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\n\nIn  addition,  approx imately  50%  of  our  employees  are  located  outside  the  United  States. Accordingly,  we  are  ex posed  to  changes  in  laws  governing  our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.\n\n## Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws and regulatory requirements could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.\n\nWe are subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that relate to our various business units and data processing activities, which may include sensitive, confidential, and personal information. These laws, regulations and codes are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. G overnment officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, including the transferring of personal information across international borders. This scrutiny can result in new and shifting interpretations of ex isting laws, thereby further impacting our business. For ex ample, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (for ex ample, Standard Contractual Clauses and the EU - US Data Privacy Framework) are the subject of legal challenge, regulatory interpretation and judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Several other countries, including but not limited to the United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and certain countries have also established specific legal requirements for data localization (such as where personal data must remain stored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers' business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions. Additionally, the G eneral Data Protection Regulation in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom continues to be interpreted by European and UK courts in novel ways leading to shifting requirements, country-specific differences in application and uncertain enforcement priorities. Laws in Asia, such as the Personal Information Protection Law in China and developing laws in India, as well as state laws in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the V irginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes and regulatory requirements, create additional privacy and security compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, G overnance, and Incident Disclosure requires us to make certain disclosures related",

      "answer": "AMD reduced its debt by $47 million in 2020 through conversions of its 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, which contributed to a decrease in interest expense from $47 million in 2020 to $34 million in 2021. In contrast, Microsoft redeemed $985 million of Nuance's convertible senior notes prior to June 30, 2022, with only $1 million remaining outstanding, indicating a much larger-scale debt restructuring following the acquisition. This redemption aligns with Microsoft's strategic integration of Nuance into its Intelligent Cloud segment, where Nuance's technologies and professional services are now embedded to drive synergies, though specific revenue contributions from Nuance within the segment are not disclosed.",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

Similarly, AVGO faces product availability risks that could result from supply chain disruptions, including those caused by limited manufacturing capacity or allocation decisions by shared suppliers like TSMC.

Apple distributes v ersions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google prov ides a hosted messaging and productiv ity suite. Meta offers communication tools to enable productiv ity and engagement within organizations. Proofpoint and Symantec prov ide security solutions across email security, information protection, and gov ernance. Slack prov ides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers v ideoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Web-based offerings competing with indiv idual applications hav e also positioned themselv es as alternativ es to our products and serv ices. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productiv ity and collaboration tools and serv ices that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already hav e both on-premises or in the cloud.\n\nLinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource serv ices; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that prov ide learning and development products and serv ices. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate rev enue from adv ertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.\n\nDynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution prov iders such as Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Serv ice Now, UI Path, and WorkDay.\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, priv ate, and hybrid serv er products and cloud serv ices that can power modern business and developers.

Azure enables customers to dev ote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure rev enue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-serv ice and platform-as-a-serv ice consumption-based serv ices, and per user-based serv ices such as Enterprise Mobility + Security.\n\nAzure AI offerings prov ide a competitiv e adv antage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. With Azure's purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure, customers can use a v ariety of large language models and dev eloper tools to create the next generation of AI apps and serv ices.\n\nOur serv er products are designed to make IT professionals, dev elopers, and their systems more productiv e and efficient. Serv er software is integrated serv er infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Serv er operating system. This includes the serv er platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, v irtualization, serv ice-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software dev elopment lifecycle tools for software architects, dev elopers, testers, and project managers.

      "answer": "NVIDIA depends heavily on third-party manufacturers outside the U.S. for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging, with 56% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue coming from international markets. If these manufacturers face disruptions\u2014such as geopolitical instability, environmental events, or capacity constraints\u2014it could lead to supply delays, lower yields, or quality issues. AMD's 10-K highlights that third-party manufacturers may prioritize other customers, increase prices, or reduce deliveries, which could directly affect NVIDIA\u2019s ability to maintain consistent product quality and delivery timelines. Meanwhile, Salesforce explicitly emphasizes compliance with high performance standards, particularly in areas like reliability, data protection, and service availability, which are critical for its AI-powered Customer 360 platform. If NVIDIA experiences manufacturing inconsistencies, it may struggle to meet Salesforce's stringent performance expectations, especially in shared enterprise AI and data infrastructure applications.",

      "question": "How do the supply chain risks related to third-party manufacturing capacity allocation in AMD's 2022 filing compare with the subcontractor strategies described in TXN's disclosures and MSFT's reliance on contract manufacturers?",
      "answer": "Based on their 2022 filings, AMD faces significant risks due to its dependence on third-party manufacturers, including the potential for capacity allocation preferences toward competitors, limited control over delivery schedules, and contractual obligations under the GF wafer supply agreement that could result in financial penalties if purchase targets are not met. In contrast, TXN maintains greater internal manufacturing control, with over 80% of wafers produced in-house and only about 40% of assembly/test services outsourced to subcontractors, which reduces its exposure to third-party capacity constraints. MSFT, while not directly involved in semiconductor manufacturing, relies heavily on third-party contract manufacturers for its devices, some of which include components with very few qualified suppliers, limiting its flexibility in the event of supplier unavailability. Thus, while all three companies face risks from external manufacturing dependencies, AMD appears most directly exposed to capacity allocation risks, TXN maintains a more balanced and controlled approach, and MSFT's exposure is more downstream, tied to component availability and device-level manufacturing.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TXN \u2192 Subcontractors: TXN outsources about 40% of its assembly and test services to subcontractors, but maintains internal control over the majority of its manufacturing capacity, reducing dependency risk.",
        "Hop 2: Subcontractors \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: AMD explicitly states its dependence on third-party manufacturers for wafer fabrication and ATMP services, highlighting risks such as capacity allocation, delivery schedules, and contractual obligations under the GF agreement.",
        "Hop 3: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2190 MSFT: MSFT's devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which rely on components with very few qualified suppliers, creating potential bottlenecks and limited flexibility if a supplier becomes unavailable."

          "chunk_text": "We continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our longterm capacity planning. Progress and investments include:\n\n- continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022;\n- purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and\n- planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nTogether, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances.\n\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.\n\n## Inventory\n\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio.

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  ('GAAP'),  and  growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud  services  metrics  and  changes  to  align  with  how  we  manage  our  Windows  OEM  and  Search  and  news  advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&amp;A.",

      "answer": "The EU AI Act, adopted in 2024 and phased in through 2030, introduces evolving compliance requirements that could affect both Salesforce\u2019s Agentforce for Sales and Adobe\u2019s Firefly AI offerings. Salesforce relies on AI technology across its product suite, including Agentforce for Sales, which uses AI agents to enhance seller productivity. Adobe, similarly, has integrated generative AI into its offerings, particularly with Adobe Firefly. Both companies face increased compliance costs and potential operational adjustments due to the Act\u2019s requirements around transparency, data governance, and model explainability. The complexity of generative AI models, such as those used in Agentforce and Firefly, makes it difficult to ensure full compliance with regulations that demand documentation of decision-making processes, raising the risk of non-compliance and reputational harm for both firms.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

      "question": "How do Adobe's compliance costs related to Saudi Arabia's data localization laws compare to Microsoft's financial exposure from similar regulations, and what does this reveal about their respective cloud service strategies?",
      "answer": "Adobe faces significant compliance costs due to its global operations, including exposure to Saudi Arabia's data localization requirements, which could 'adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers' business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions' (ADBE_10k_2024.pdf). Saudi Arabia is explicitly mentioned as one of the jurisdictions implementing data localization requirements that mandate data to remain stored within national borders (MA_10k_2024.pdf). Microsoft discloses that such localization laws globally 'may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency' and specifically references compliance engineering costs that 'involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects' (MSFT_10k_2024.pdf). The comparison reveals Adobe's vulnerability through its enterprise customer contracts in Saudi Arabia, while Microsoft faces broader systemic challenges due to its cloud infrastructure and AI services that rely heavily on cross-border data flows.",

In addition, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.\n\nWe have not prevailed, and may not in the future prevail, in every lawsuit or dispute. For further information about specific litigation and proceedings, see the section titled 'Legal Proceedings' contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.\n\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These local, state, federal and international laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade laws such as import and export controls, anti-boycott, economic sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, consumer protection, records management, usergenerated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, AI regulations, corporate governance, antitrust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and evolving, and may at times conflict. Further, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which may conflict with local customs and practices in other foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies where it is common to engage in practices that would be prohibited under such laws. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, business partners and vendors will not take actions in violation of our internal policies, U.S. laws or other applicable international laws. Compliance with the above laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require additional changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\n\nIn  addition,  approx imately  50%  of  our  employees  are  located  outside  the  United  States. Accordingly,  we  are  ex posed  to  changes  in  laws  governing  our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.\n\n## Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws and regulatory requirements could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.\n\nWe are subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that relate to our various business units and data processing activities, which may include sensitive, confidential, and personal information. These laws, regulations and codes are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. G overnment officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, including the transferring of personal information across international borders. This scrutiny can result in new and shifting interpretations of ex isting laws, thereby further impacting our business. For ex ample, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (for ex ample, Standard Contractual Clauses and the EU - US Data Privacy Framework) are the subject of legal challenge, regulatory interpretation and judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Several other countries, including but not limited to the United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and certain countries have also established specific legal requirements for data localization (such as where personal data must remain stored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers' business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions. Additionally, the G eneral Data Protection Regulation in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom continues to be interpreted by European and UK courts in novel ways leading to shifting requirements, country-specific differences in application and uncertain enforcement priorities. Laws in Asia, such as the Personal Information Protection Law in China and developing laws in India, as well as state laws in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the V irginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes and regulatory requirements, create additional privacy and security compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, G overnance, and Incident Disclosure requires us to make certain disclosures related",

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and inv estment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and serv ices to, or making inv estments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for gov ernment rev iew of transactions inv olv ing information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adv ersaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the av ailability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly ev olv ing sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned indiv iduals and countries, and (2) negativ e impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of rev enue, increased costs, loss of export priv ileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based serv ices internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolv e. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Priv acy Framework ('DPF') has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities hav e and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based serv ices that inv olv e the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of deliv ering our products and serv ices. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which applies to all of our activ ities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and serv ices offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been dev eloping new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Serv ices Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and serv ices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws inv olv e substantial expense and the div ersion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractiv e. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, priv ate lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR hav e recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies, and European data protection authorities hav e taken action to block or remov e serv ices from their markets. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. hav e adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n\nOur inv estment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the v alue of the serv ices we deliv er to customers, including AI serv ices, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory dev elopments that impede realizing the expected return from this inv estment. Ongoing legal analyses, rev iews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relev ant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sov ereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, mov ement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in serv ices, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower rev enue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innov ate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activ ity, negativ e publicity, and div ersion of management time and effort.",

Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

Progress and investments include:\n\n- continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022;\n- purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and\n- planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nTogether, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances.\n\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.\n\n## Inventory\n\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's exposure to inventory write-downs from long manufacturing lead times influence its ability to pivot toward rapidly evolving AI technologies, compared to Qualcomm's decade-long investment in on-device AI development for automotive and IoT applications?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA faces a 2.3% unfavorable impact on gross margin in fiscal year 2025 from inventory provisions, with manufacturing lead times sometimes exceeding twelve months, which increases the risk of obsolescence as AI technologies rapidly evolve. This creates a structural challenge for NVIDIA to adapt its product offerings to shifting AI demands. In contrast, Qualcomm has invested in AI for over a decade, focusing on power-efficient, on-device AI capabilities tailored for automotive and IoT applications, with specialized SoC engines like NPU designed for low-power AI computing. These strategic R&D investments allow Qualcomm to integrate AI more fluidly into diversified markets, reducing its dependency on any single AI product cycle and enhancing agility compared to NVIDIA's inventory-constrained flexibility.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Product Offerings: NVIDIA's inventory write-downs from long manufacturing lead times (exceeding twelve months) create financial exposure and reduce agility in adapting to changing AI product demands, as seen by the 2.3% unfavorable gross margin impact in FY2025.",
        "Hop 2: Product Offerings \u2192 AI Technologies: Rapid evolution of AI technologies increases the risk of product obsolescence, especially for companies with long production cycles, making it harder to pivot offerings to meet new AI standards.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\n\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly , ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\n\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity . We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross M argin discussion below in this M anagement's Discussion and A nalysis for further discussion.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality  to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Revenue Allowances\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\n\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or M DFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.",

The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by M icron, a supplier of ours. A s another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an A ction Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the A ction Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability  of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\nFinally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in T aiwan and South Korea. A ny new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from T aiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n## Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. A dditionally , our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or ex pose us to liability .\n\n## Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as A I, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability  and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building A I capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone A I applications. A I poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as A I solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy , employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability . Lev eraging A I capabilities to potentially  improv e our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to A I may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for General Purpose A rtificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy A I processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in A I-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of A I by  us or others could undermine public confidence in A I and slow adoption of A I in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\n\n## Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify . A n unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctiv e relief.

      "answer": "Qualcomm's business and products, including those of its customers and licensees, are subject to a broad range of regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which govern the export and re-export of advanced technologies, potentially affecting its business operations and results. In contrast, AMD faces specific export constraints under EAR, including requirements to file a Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification 25 days before shipping certain Versal VC2602 and VE2602 FPGAs to China or to customers outside the U.S. whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country, including China. These FPGAs are part of AMD's Data Center segment, which includes Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and other adaptive computing products. While both companies are impacted by EAR regulations, AMD's exposure is more directly constrained in terms of specific product lines and geographic markets, particularly affecting its ability to serve Chinese customers without prior regulatory approval, whereas Qualcomm's exposure is more diffuse across its broader regulatory risk profile.",

      "question": "How might Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy, which includes expanding manufacturing capacity with the aim of attracting foundry customers, be affected by Samsung's development of in-house integrated circuits, and what implications could this have for Qualcomm's semiconductor business given its reliance on external integrated circuit customers?",
      "answer": "Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves significant capital expenditures to expand manufacturing capacity with the goal of attracting foundry customers (chunk 1). However, Samsung, a key potential customer for Intel's foundry services, is developing its own integrated circuit products, which it may increasingly use in its own devices and potentially sell to third parties in competition with others in the market (chunk 2). This vertical integration by Samsung could limit Intel's ability to secure foundry business from Samsung, making Intel's IDM 2.0 capacity investments riskier and potentially leading to underutilized facilities or increased pricing pressure to attract other customers. Qualcomm, which derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of its own integrated circuit products to OEMs (chunk 3), could face intensified competition if Samsung's in-house chips gain market traction, particularly in segments like mobile and automotive. Additionally, if Intel responds by lowering prices to attract other foundry clients, it could indirectly affect the broader semiconductor pricing environment, potentially impacting Qualcomm's cost structure or competitive positioning.",

          "chunk_text": "Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuations in demand and we may incur significant charges and costs. Because we own and operate high-tech fabrication facilities, our operations have high costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term, including our costs related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&amp;D, and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges, which would lower our gross margin. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation. As we make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened. Conversely, at times demand increases or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n\nOur IDM 2.0 investments in capacity and our process technology roadmap will require capital expenditures above our historical levels, and if demand for our IFS business grows rapidly, we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investments to meet that demand. To the extent we do not generate expected cash flows, we may be required to increase our use of external funding sources to fund our investments and operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. There is legislation under consideration in the US and EU to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but there can be no assurance that such funding will be enacted, and there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to any restrictions on recipients. To the extent such funding is below our expectations, our anticipated cash requirements would increase. Our construction projects to expand capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages, and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays and increased costs for our projects.\n\nWe face significant competition. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future.\n\nOur products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive factors. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operation can be harmed.\n\nWe face intense competition across our product portfolio from companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products; connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms, such as the ARM architecture, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers. Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.\n\nMost of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products. Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors. While we have set out a process technology roadmap to attain future process performance-per-watt parity and leadership relative to TSMC, our plans are subject to a number of risks and we could fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and the risks described in the section \"We are vulnerable to product and manufacturingrelated risks.\" As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&amp;D spending than many of our \"fabless\" competitors. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

Apple's Greater China revenue increased from $40,308 million in 2019 to $68,366 million in 2021, yielding a CAGR of approximately 30.8%.

The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

      "answer": "AMD is complying with U.S. export control regulations that affect its operations with the THATIC JV, a joint venture with a Chinese entity that was added to the Entity List in June 2019. This limits AMD's ability to engage in certain technology transfers and sales to THATIC. Similarly, Intel reports that export restrictions tied to U.S.-China trade tensions have reduced its sales, particularly as billings to China accounted for 27% of its total revenue in the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021. Both companies face regulatory constraints that limit their exposure to the Chinese market, though AMD\u2019s exposure is more specific to joint ventures and intellectual property licensing, while Intel\u2019s is broader in terms of geographic revenue concentration.",

        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Export Control Regulations: AMD complies with U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on the THATIC JV, which was added to the Entity List in 2019, limiting AMD's business activities with it.",
        "Hop 2: Export Control Regulations \u2192 Export Restrictions: These regulations have a direct negative impact on business operations, particularly for companies with exposure to restricted Chinese entities or markets.",

We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&amp;D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 82% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, with revenue from billings to China contributing 27% of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.\n\nAdverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.\n\nWe can be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:\n\n- geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for example, geopolitical tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where our Mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facilities are located;\n- natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other catastrophic events;\n- inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n- formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export licenses, which could be changed without notice;\n- government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n- adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;\n- differing employment practices and labor issues;\n- ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n- local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n- continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and\n- fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.\n\nWe are also subject to risks related to the cessation of US dollar LIBOR. Certain of our derivatives and floating-rate investments reference US dollar LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on US dollar LIBOR. No new US dollar LIBOR-based activity should be conducted after 2021, and US dollar LIBOR will be unavailable for use in our existing contracts and financial instruments beyond June 30, 2023. While reasonable alternatives to LIBOR have been introduced into markets, our transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.\n\nWe are subject to risks related to trade policies and regulations. Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets.\n\nIn particular, trade tensions between the US and China have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. The US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. These restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance, result in reputational harm to us, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, which may include trade restrictions and additional or increased tariffs and export controls imposed on short notice, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such actions.\n\nOther Key Information\n\n57",

      "answer": "QCOM derives a significant portion of its licensing revenues from Chinese OEMs, with 30% of total licensing revenue coming from this group of manufacturers. Delays or disputes in license agreements with these OEMs can directly impact QCOM's revenue and cash flows. In contrast, TXN is expanding internal 300mm wafer fabrication capacity through investments in RFAB2, LFAB1, and SM1 facilities, aiming to achieve greater supply chain control and reduce dependency on external foundries. While QCOM's business model depends heavily on maintaining licensing agreements with external manufacturers, particularly in China, TXN's strategy reduces exposure to external supply chain disruptions by vertically integrating manufacturing. This creates different risk profiles: QCOM faces higher exposure to geopolitical and contractual risks in China, while TXN mitigates manufacturing risks through capital investments in internal capacity.",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world.

      "answer": "NVIDIA's supply chain is heavily dependent on foundry partners located in Taiwan, as noted in its 2023 10-K filing, where it explicitly states that supply constraints or geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan could severely impact its ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect revenue. These foundry partners operate in Taiwan, a region identified in Qualcomm\u2019s 2023 10-K as a critical node in semiconductor manufacturing and a potential flashpoint for geopolitical instability. Intel, in its 2023 10-K, reported $6.867 billion in net revenue from Taiwan in the most recent fiscal year, indicating a significant but declining financial footprint in the region over the past three years (from $11.418 billion in 2021). This suggests that while both companies are exposed to risks stemming from Taiwan, NVIDIA's vulnerability is more operational and supply-chain driven, whereas Intel\u2019s exposure is more financial and has been decreasing.",

      "answer": "Intel's development and release of high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming-focused products, creates a dual competitive challenge. For Oracle, which directly competes with Intel in enterprise solutions, this expansion increases Intel's market influence and competitive pressure in the IT industry. For AMD, whose Gaming segment generated $1.353 billion in revenue and primarily includes discrete GPUs, Intel's entry threatens its market position by leveraging Intel's significant financial resources, aggressive business practices, and potential preferential access to proprietary graphics interfaces. This dynamic exposes both Oracle and AMD to intensified competition from Intel's expanded product portfolio and strategic advantages.",

      "answer": "Intel utilizes Level 2 valuation inputs, including model-derived valuations corroborated with observable market data such as discounted cash flows, yield curves, and credit ratings, to estimate fair values for its financial assets and liabilities. These inputs are consistent with methodologies used by third-party pricing services that incorporate broker-dealer quotes, as seen in the second hop evidence. Texas Instruments similarly depends on broker-dealer quotes\u2014classified as Level 2 inputs\u2014for the fair value estimation of its long-term debt, which had a carrying value of $13.60 billion and an estimated fair value of $12.48 billion as of December 31, 2024. Both companies rely on external financial institutions to apply standardized valuation models, highlighting a shared dependency on observable, model-supported pricing mechanisms despite differing applications in asset classes.",

          "chunk_text": "## Government Incentives\n\nGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or modelderived valuations. A ll significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV  that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n- Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV  that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.\n- Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net . The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nNon-marketable equity investments and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n64",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

      "answer": "Oracle notes that changes such as the OECD's 15% global minimum tax could materially increase its international tax burden, particularly as it operates in jurisdictions where it may be subject to this new regime. In contrast, Microsoft, which is also subject to the Pillar Two Model Rules starting in fiscal year 2025, currently estimates no material impact on its consolidated financial statements due to its existing tax structure, including its foreign regional operations center in Ireland that benefits from lower tax rates. While Oracle faces potential volatility in its tax provision due to these international tax changes, Microsoft's current geographic income mix and strategic positioning suggest a more buffered impact under the same global tax framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ORCL \u2192 Global Minimum Tax: Oracle states that the 15% global minimum tax could materially increase its international tax costs and impact its effective tax rate.",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

These cost of sales decreases were partially offset by $695 million of higher period charges in 2023, primarily related to excess capacity charges and higher intersegment inventory reserves taken in 2023.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses were $4.4 billion, down $214 million from 2022, driven by various cost-reduction measures.\n\n## All Other\n\nOur \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our A ltera and M obileye businesses, start-up businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses. A ltera offers programmable semiconductors, primarily FPGAs, and related products, for a broad range of applications across our embedded, communications, and cloud and enterprise market segments. We previously announced the organization of Altera as a standalone business. We are pursuing monetization opportunities with A ltera and remain focused on selling a stake in the business on its path to a potential IPO in the coming years.

Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; howev er, we are increasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we hav e increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and serv ices solutions into Enterprise, high performance computing (HPC) and Cloud Serv ice Prov ider customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of serv ers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\n\n## Hyperscale Data Centers\n\nLarge multi-national public cloud serv ice prov iders and hyperscale priv ate data centers directly and indirectly purchase a substantial portion of our data center-focused products, including serv er CPUs, GPU accelerators, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptiv e SOCs. These products are incorporated into serv ers and other data center appliances sold by OEMs to the hyperscale customers or into custom serv ers or hardware designed by or for these customers and manufactured by ODMs or contract manufacturers. Hyperscale data centers use these products to operate web-based applications or to support public cloud computing and storage serv ice offerings, including but not limited to AI workloads such as generativ e AI models.\n\n## Third-Party Distributors\n\nOur  authorized  channel  distributors  resell  to  sub-distributors,  OEMs,  ODMs,  and  other  customers.  T ypically,  distributors  handle  a  wide  v ariety  of products,  and  may  include  products  from  other  manufacturers  that  compete  with  our  products.  Distributors  typically  maintain  an  inv entory  of  our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions and prov ide certain return rights with respect to any product that we hav e remov ed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation prov isions permitting limited product returns.\n\n## Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\n\nWe offer component-lev el graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-lev el products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retailers and sub distributors. In most instances, our agreements with AIBs protect their inv entory of our products against price reductions.  We  also  sell  directly  to  some  SI  customers.  SIs  typically  sell  from  positions  of  regional  or  product-based  strength  in  the  market.  T hey usually  operate  on  short  design  cycles  and  can  respond  quickly  with  new  technologies.  SIs  often  use  discrete  graphics  solutions  as  a  means  to differentiate their products and add v alue to their customers.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitiv e and deliv ering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achiev ing  rev enue  growth.  We  believ e  that  the  main  factors  that  determine  our  product  competitiv eness  are  total  cost  of  ownership,  timely  product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including accelerations for key workloads such as AI), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life, giv en their impact on total cost of ownership), reliability, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), lev el of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of  software  design  tools,  completeness  of  applicable  software  solutions,  security  and  stability,  brand  recognition  and  av ailability.  We  expect  that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products  that  may  prov ide  better  performance  or  experiences  or  that  may  include  additional  features  that  render  our  products  comparativ ely  less competitiv e.",

Meanwhile, NVDA explicitly states reliance on foundry partners in Taiwan for GPU manufacturing, with potential supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions impacting their ability to fulfill customer orders. QCOM's 10-K filing highlights that foundry supply from Taiwan is critical to semiconductor operations and a prolonged conflict could severely limit chipset supply. Together, this creates a dual vulnerability: AVGO risks impairment of its physical assets in Taiwan, while NVDA faces operational disruption to its core product manufacturing, both amplifying their shared exposure to cross-strait geopolitical instability in 2023.",

      "answer": "AVGO categorizes its investments, including equity and short-term money market instruments, as Level 2 securities when they are valued using inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and broker quotes. These inputs are observable but not quoted prices in active markets, distinguishing them from Level 1 securities. Matrix pricing, which is used for Level 2 securities like corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, relies on observable market data such as yield curves to estimate fair value. ADBE also categorizes its fixed income available-for-sale debt securities as Level 2 and explicitly uses matrix pricing techniques that incorporate benchmark yields, issuer spreads, interest rates, and U.S. Treasury or swap curves to determine fair value. Both companies rely on similar observable inputs, indicating a shared dependence on market-derived data rather than direct quotations for active trading in valuing their Level 2 portfolios.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Level 2 Securities: AVGO discloses that its Level 2 securities are valued using inputs like interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, and broker quotes, which are observable but not directly quoted prices in active markets.",
        "Hop 2: Level 2 Securities \u2192 Matrix Pricing: Matrix pricing is a valuation technique used for Level 2 securities such as corporate and asset-backed bonds, relying on observable inputs like yield curves and market-corroborated pricing models.",
        "Hop 3: Matrix Pricing \u2190 ADBE: ADBE explicitly depends on matrix pricing for valuing its fixed income available-for-sale debt securities, using inputs including benchmark yields, issuer spreads, and interest rates, which aligns with the observable inputs described in matrix pricing."

      "question": "How does the impact of U.S. export control restrictions on NVIDIA's ability to serve customers in specific foreign markets compare to Intel's operational footprint in those same countries?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA is restricted from exporting several high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and B200, to countries in Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (e.g., China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Vietnam), and has not received licenses to ship these products to China. These restrictions significantly limit NVIDIA's access to key international markets. Meanwhile, Intel operates in these same 'Other Countries,' with 32 million square feet of facilities, indicating a substantial physical presence in regions affected by these export controls. This suggests that while NVIDIA faces regulatory barriers limiting its market access, Intel maintains a significant operational infrastructure in those same geographies, potentially allowing it to navigate or adapt to regulatory changes differently.",

The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NV L 72 and NV L 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. A dditionally , we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of A I and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the M iddle East and countries designated 'Tier 2' by the A I Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly , could impact our ability  to dev elop and supply  solutions for our automotive customers.\n\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the A sia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

These controls prev ent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct\u2122 integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a  Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring  a  license  application  before  shipping  a  product  that  is  the  subject  of  a  NAC  notification.  BIS  may  issue  new  licensing  requirements  and regulatory controls in the future. Ev en new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we hav e no assurances BIS will agree that the alternativ e products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternativ e products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result  in  lost  sales  adv ersely  impacting  our  reputation  and  business.  T here  is  also  a  possibility  of  future  tariffs,  trade  protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may adv ersely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to prov ide serv ices or dev elop products in the United States.\n\nUnited States export control regulations include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain AI technologies to United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, gov ernments, persons and entities. If there are changes to those regulations, or to the categorization of our products under those regulations, our ability to sell our products and serv ices outside the United States may be harmed. The United States and its allies continue to focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products and serv ices. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral controls. The scope and application of such controls hav e been and may again be v ery broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or prov iding access to our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negativ ely impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and serv ices are further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or serv ices could be further restricted. We may be at a competitiv e disadv antage if our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls hav e, and may in the future, subject downstream recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair or transfer of our products and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nWe may, from time to time, receiv e technical data from third parties that is subject to the International T raffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  Export Administration  Regulation  (EAR)  gov erns  the  export  and  re-export  of  certain AMD  products, including FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or prov ision of serv ices, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications or Notification Adv anced Computing (NAC) exception notices we hav e no assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will act on the filings in a timely manner. Ev en if BIS grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export priv ileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractiv e to ov erseas customers, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n## If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positiv e and negativ e ev idence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",

      "answer": "Intel faces risks from compulsory licensing regulations that weaken its ability to enforce IP rights and derive value from its patents, particularly in jurisdictions where governments may require IP licensing at reduced rates or under unfavorable terms. This undermines Intel\u2019s competitive position by potentially reducing its leverage in IP negotiations and diminishing returns on R&D investments. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's business model heavily depends on licensing agreements with OEMs, several of whom, such as Huawei and Transsion, have either delayed renewals or refused to pay fair royalties. These OEMs are actively seeking to reduce licensing costs, often through legal challenges or by lobbying for compulsory licensing frameworks. The combination of Intel\u2019s vulnerability to compulsory licensing and Qualcomm\u2019s direct conflict with resistant OEMs creates a dynamic where both companies face pressure on IP monetization, but Qualcomm is more directly and immediately impacted due to its licensing-dependent revenue model.",

We rely on IP law-as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others -to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in v arious countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations and governments or courts render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability  to enforce our IP rights under any  of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&amp;D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\n\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally  license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\n\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. For example, in February 2024, R2 Semiconductor, Inc., a non-practicing entity, was able to obtain an injunction and recall order against us and our customers in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany that, if enforced, could have caused significant potential disruption to our and our customers' businesses in Europe. In the past few years, we have faced costly and lengthy lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions selected by non-practicing entities with well-funded third-party investment support, including most notably the V LSI and R2 litigation, which have resulted in significant adverse judgments and settlements.\n\nWe are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. A ny such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances, we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n\n- pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, penalties, or provide accommodations to customers such as through cash payments or discounts;\n- stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n- need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n- enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.\n\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n40",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and a leading developer and supplier of 5G integrated circuit products in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.\n\nAs we look forward to the next several quarters:\n\n- We expect transitions to new generations of leading process technology nodes to continue to drive product cost increases from certain of our key semiconductor wafer suppliers.\n- We expect continued intense competition, including from vertical integration by certain of our customers (e.g., Apple).\n- Current U.S./China trade relations and/or national security protection policies may negatively impact our business, growth prospects and results of operations. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.'\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we ex tended, renewed or entered into license agreements with several key OEMs. We are currently pursuing negotiations with other key OEMs whose agreements expire in early fiscal 2025 (including Huawei). In addition, in fiscal 2024, we entered into a license agreement with Shenzhen Transsion Holdings Limited (a growing, China-headquartered OEM that sells primarily in developing regions) for its 5G products. While we continue to engage in negotiations toward a comprehensive resolution, we have initiated litigation against Transsion in multiple jurisdictions to enforce our intellectual property rights against certain of its unlicensed products. See 'Risk Factors' in this Annual Report, including the Risk Factors titled ' The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring ' and 'The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions. '\n\nWe are also involved in other legal proceedings, including those described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Litigation is inherently uncertain, and, while we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless industry and governments as to the benefits of our licensing programs and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technologies and not welcome the success of our licensing programs in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. Accordingly, such companies, and/or governments or regulators, may continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.\n\nFurther discussion of risks related to our business is provided in 'Part I, Item 1A.

At September 25, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was approximately $14.0 billion.\n\nAt September 25, 2022, with the exception of $500 million of outstanding unsecured floating-rate notes due January 30, 2023, all of our outstanding long-term debt is comprised of unsecured fixed-rate notes. We may redeem the outstanding fixed-rate notes at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at specified make-whole premiums as defined in the applicable form of note. We may not redeem the outstanding floating-rate notes prior to maturity. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe effective interest rates for the notes include the interest on the notes, amortization of the discount, which includes debt issuance costs, and if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. Interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. Cash interest paid related to our commercial paper program and long-term debt, net of cash received from the related interest rate swaps, was $491 million, $477 million and $507 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we terminated $1 billion of swaps associated with our May 2022 Notes, and the related gains of $123 million are being reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt.\n\nAt September 25, 2022, we had outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.1 billion that are designated as fair value hedges and allow us to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on a portion of our outstanding long-term debt.\n\nCommercial Paper Program . We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion. Net proceeds from this program are for general corporate purposes. Maturities of commercial paper can range from 1 to up to 397 days. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had $499 million and $500 million, respectively, of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.69% and 0.13%, respectively, which included fees paid to the commercial paper dealers. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, the weighted-average remaining days to maturity were 27 days and 39 days, respectively. The carrying value of the outstanding commercial paper approximated its estimated fair value at September 25, 2022.\n\nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a Revolving Credit Facility that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.5 billion, which expires on December 8, 2025.

The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million.\n\nPrior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a 'make whole' premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\n\n## Debt Covenants and Seniority\n\nThe  7.50%  Notes  require  the  Company  to  comply  with  certain  financial  covenants  and  a  number  of  restrictive covenants.

The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Future Payments on Total Debt\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, the Company's future debt payment obligations were as follows:\n\n",

The 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes rank junior to all of the  Company's  future  senior  secured  debt  to  the  extent  of  the  collateral  securing  such  debt  and  are  structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\n\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nThe Company is party to a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $50 million swingline sub-facility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company's option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n## Future Payments on Total Debt\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, the Company's future debt payment obligations were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Oracle's integration of generative AI in MySQL HeatWave and Qualcomm's investment in IoT applications reflect their respective strategies for on-device AI processing in enterprise and consumer markets?",
      "answer": "Oracle integrates generative AI into Oracle MySQL HeatWave, offering it as a managed cloud service that combines transactions, real-time analytics, machine learning, and generative AI capabilities. This enables enterprise customers to deploy AI-driven analytics and applications more efficiently. In contrast, Qualcomm is investing heavily in expanding generative AI into IoT and edge devices, projecting that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024. Qualcomm\u2019s QCT segment develops integrated circuits for IoT applications, including consumer electronics, industrial devices, and edge networking products, emphasizing on-device processing for immediacy, privacy, and personalization. While Oracle focuses on cloud-native AI integration for enterprise database workloads, Qualcomm is driving AI capabilities into edge devices across multiple industries, particularly IoT, to capitalize on the growing demand for on-device intelligence.",

      "question": "How might the compliance costs associated with the EU AI Act, which Adobe anticipates will require costly changes to its AI development practices, affect its competitive positioning against Salesforce, which relies heavily on its AI-powered Agentforce platform for sales and service offerings?",
      "answer": "Adobe anticipates that the EU AI Act, which will be implemented in phases through 2030, may require costly changes to its AI development practices, including delays or halts in development, changes to monetization strategies, and increased compliance costs. Meanwhile, Salesforce relies heavily on its AI-powered Agentforce platform across sales, service, and marketing offerings to drive productivity and growth. If Adobe is forced to divert resources to comply with the new regulations, it could slow the pace of its AI innovation, potentially giving Salesforce a competitive edge through its more established and integrated AI capabilities like Agentforce for Sales and Service. The GS_10k_2024 chunk reinforces that evolving AI regulations increase compliance costs and operational risks for companies relying on AI, suggesting both firms face similar pressures, but Salesforce\u2019s deeper integration of AI across its platform may make it better positioned to absorb such regulatory changes.",

        "Hop 1: ADBE \u2192 AI Regulations: Adobe identifies the EU AI Act as a risk that may require costly changes to its AI development practices, including delays or halts in development and increased compliance costs through 2030.",
        "Hop 2: AI Regulations \u2192 AI Technology: The evolving regulatory environment, including the EU AI Act, increases compliance costs and operational risks for companies developing or deploying AI technologies, as noted in GS_10k_2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's production of operating systems intersect with AMD's dependency on Microsoft for OS support in enabling x86-based microprocessor compatibility for enterprise hardware environments?",
      "answer": "Oracle produces operating systems that are part of its hardware business, which provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, and virtualization to support diverse IT environments. These systems rely on operating systems to function effectively. AMD depends on Microsoft Corporation to design and develop its operating systems to run on or support AMD's x86-based microprocessor products. This dependency means that for Oracle's enterprise hardware to effectively support AMD-based systems, Microsoft must ensure its operating systems are compatible with AMD's x86 instruction sets. Without Microsoft's continued OS development support, AMD's ability to innovate beyond Intel-controlled x86 standards\u2014and Oracle's ability to provide fully compatible infrastructure\u2014would be materially adversely affected.",

At September 25, 2022, the aggregate fair value of the notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was approximately $14.0 billion.\n\nAt September 25, 2022, with the exception of $500 million of outstanding unsecured floating-rate notes due January 30, 2023, all of our outstanding long-term debt is comprised of unsecured fixed-rate notes. We may redeem the outstanding fixed-rate notes at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at specified make-whole premiums as defined in the applicable form of note. We may not redeem the outstanding floating-rate notes prior to maturity. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe effective interest rates for the notes include the interest on the notes, amortization of the discount, which includes debt issuance costs, and if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. Interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. Cash interest paid related to our commercial paper program and long-term debt, net of cash received from the related interest rate swaps, was $491 million, $477 million and $507 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had outstanding forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we terminated $1 billion of swaps associated with our May 2022 Notes, and the related gains of $123 million are being reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the related debt.\n\nAt September 25, 2022, we had outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.1 billion that are designated as fair value hedges and allow us to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments on a portion of our outstanding long-term debt.\n\nCommercial Paper Program . We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion. Net proceeds from this program are for general corporate purposes. Maturities of commercial paper can range from 1 to up to 397 days. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, we had $499 million and $500 million, respectively, of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.69% and 0.13%, respectively, which included fees paid to the commercial paper dealers. At September 25, 2022 and September 26, 2021, the weighted-average remaining days to maturity were 27 days and 39 days, respectively. The carrying value of the outstanding commercial paper approximated its estimated fair value at September 25, 2022.\n\nRevolving Credit Facility. We have a Revolving Credit Facility that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.5 billion, which expires on December 8, 2025. At September 25, 2022, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.",

We do this in service of delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today's complex and unpredictable world.\n\n## Customer Priorities\n\n## Modernize Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure, including through automation to manage and monitor each connection in real time.\n\nWe continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form an integrated architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that simplifies and helps secure networking for customers at scale.\n\nOur  Observability  offerings  collect  and  process  daily  measurements  from  customers'  owned  and  unowned  networks,  providing  automated  insights,  proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers to enable them to reduce mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT productivity and user experience.\n\nFor the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside. We continue to make significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, which we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future.\n\nAs part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions to help them communicate more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.\n\n## Improve Cybersecurity\n\nWith the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point solutions to a platform comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network; and harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk Inc. ('Splunk') to prevent, detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.\n\n## Harness the Power of AI and Data\n\nAI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher requirement for network connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and inference workloads for both webscalers and enterprises. We help to scale our customers' network infrastructure with high-density routers and  switches,  improved  network  management,  and  high-performance  optics.  We  are  reinventing  data  center  operations  for  our  customers  by  simplifying  the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.\n\nWe can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their own business data. With this breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights and contex t to customers, leading them to more informed proactive decisions and better business results.\n\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with our  Strategy and  Priorities, see 'Item 1A.  Risk  Factors,' including the risk factor entitled 'We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.'

China Mainland is part of Apple\u2019s Greater China segment, which collectively represents a significant portion of Apple\u2019s global business. Meanwhile, Microsoft operates a regional operations center in Singapore that supports Greater China, including functions like order processing, logistics, and vendor management. If China Mainland experiences disruptions\u2014such as lockdowns or trade restrictions\u2014Apple would face supply chain and cost challenges, while Microsoft\u2019s regional service delivery could be impacted through logistics and vendor management channels.

The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.

      "question": "How does the cost profile impact of Salesforce's generative AI development, including Einstein GPT, connect to Broadcom's valuation of VMware Cloud Foundation's cost optimization capabilities in their private cloud portfolio?",
      "answer": "Salesforce's development of generative AI products like Einstein GPT increases their cost profile due to the computing-intensive nature of these systems, and they specifically highlight the risk that excessive expenses in mitigating AI-related risks could harm their financial condition. Broadcom's VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is described in their filings as a solution that 'enhances customers' ability to continuously optimize performance and costs' in cloud environments supporting both virtual machines and containerized workloads, including advanced AI and machine learning at enterprise scale. Broadcom further valued the developed technology related to VMware Cloud Foundation using the multi-period excess earnings method, reflecting the present value of projected cash flows from this product line. This creates a 3-hop connection where Salesforce faces AI-driven cost pressures, VMware Cloud Foundation offers optimization capabilities for such workloads, and Broadcom's valuation methodology demonstrates the platform's financial impact on enterprise customers.",

Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks and challenges and may result in unintended consequences that could affect its further development or our and our customers' adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations also presents further risks, costs, and challenges. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical  and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise.  The AI-related legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could also give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of new applications of ex isting data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; damage our reputation; or otherwise materially harm our business.\n\n## We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\n\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the  United  States.  Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are negatively impacted by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we ex perienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.'",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,' ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,' 'A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,' ' There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,' and 'Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.'\n\nRegulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. In addition, and especially in developing regulatory areas (for example, AI, privacy and data protection, and ESG-related reporting), Regulations may differ by country or by state within the United States, and may be conflicting in certain cases. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## There are risks associated with our debt.\n\nOur outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flex ibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our debt depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\n\n## Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to ex amination of our tax  returns and reports by tax ing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well as countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.\n\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax  rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax  rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, both of which have been proposed by the current U.S. presidential administration, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. Further, if the requirement to capitalize certain research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes is changed, as has been proposed by Congress, this would negatively affect our provision for income taxes and results of operations (although it would have a favorable impact on our cash flows from operations due to lower cash tax payments).\n\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, representing a coalition of member countries, has made certain changes, including the Pillar Two framework, which imposes a minimum tax of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. The OECD is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, if and as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "answer": "Microsoft faces increased compliance costs due to evolving data localization requirements, including engineering efforts to facilitate compliance with data sovereignty rules, which involve substantial expense and diversion of resources from other projects. Saudi Arabia is explicitly mentioned as one of the jurisdictions implementing such data localization requirements, directly affecting Microsoft\u2019s ability to offer cloud services without adapting infrastructure and operations to local laws. Meanwhile, Oracle faces significant tax audit exposure in Saudi Arabia, with up to $847 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits potentially subject to decrease over the next 12 months due to ongoing examinations. While Microsoft\u2019s challenges in Saudi Arabia are regulatory and operational in nature, Oracle\u2019s exposure centers on tax liabilities, reflecting different risk profiles despite both companies operating in the same market under evolving regulatory conditions.",

      "question": "How might a prolonged geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan impact Qualcomm's chipset supply chain differently than Intel's operational footprint in the region, given Qualcomm's reliance on Taiwan-based foundry partners and Intel's $6.867 billion in 2023 revenue tied to the region?",
      "answer": "A prolonged geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan would impact Qualcomm and Intel through different mechanisms. For Qualcomm, the risk is operational, as the company explicitly states its 'business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable chipset supply from our foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan.' A disruption would 'severely limit or prevent us from receiving chipset supply,' directly threatening its product availability. In contrast, Intel's exposure is primarily financial, with $6.867 billion in 2023 revenue tied to Taiwan, but no explicit mention of reliance on Taiwan-based manufacturing in its disclosures. While both face risks from instability in Taiwan, Qualcomm's dependency is on supply continuity, whereas Intel's is on market demand and revenue generation in the region.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 Foundry Partners: Qualcomm explicitly depends on Taiwan-based foundry partners for chipset supply, and any disruption would severely impact its business.",

        "Hop 3: Taiwan \u2190 INTC: Intel reported $6.867 billion in net revenue from Taiwan in 2023, indicating a significant financial exposure to the region, though not necessarily tied to manufacturing dependencies."

      "question": "How did the corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines enacted in Q1 2021 impact AMD's tax provision compared to Texas Instruments' operational investments in the country, given both companies' exposure to international tax regulations?",
      "answer": "The corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines enacted in Q1 2021 had a favorable impact on AMD\u2019s effective tax rate by partially offsetting increases from other tax factors, such as GILTI-related foreign tax credit limitations. Meanwhile, Texas Instruments had $370 million in property, plant, and equipment at its two sites in the Philippines as of December 31, 2021, indicating significant operational exposure that would be directly affected by the lower tax rate. AMD\u2019s 2021 effective tax rate increased by 0.1 percentage point to 21.8%, with the Philippines tax reduction noted as a mitigating factor, while TXN\u2019s capital investment in the country suggests a strategic commitment that would benefit from the lower corporate tax rate.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Tax Reform Act: AMD disclosed that the Tax Reform Act had no direct impact in 2021 but historically contributed to tax benefits or provisions, such as the $13 million impact in 2019.",
        "Hop 2: Tax Reform Act \u2192 Philippines: The corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines, enacted in Q1 2021, contributed to a favorable tax impact for U.S. multinational companies like AMD by lowering the effective tax rate by 0.1 percentage point in 2021.",
        "Hop 3: Philippines \u2190 TXN: Texas Instruments had $370 million in property, plant, and equipment in the Philippines as of December 31, 2021, indicating a substantial operational footprint that would benefit from the reduced corporate tax rate in that jurisdiction."

      "answer": "If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems to work with non-Intel x86-based microprocessors, independent software providers may avoid designing applications to take advantage of these alternative architectures. This could reduce the software ecosystem compatibility for IBM's hybrid cloud infrastructure offerings that rely on non-Intel processors, making them less attractive to clients who require broad application support. As a result, IBM could face increased competitive pressure from Microsoft's own cloud infrastructure offerings, which are optimized for Microsoft's supported processor ecosystems, potentially affecting IBM's market share and revenue growth in the hybrid cloud segment.",

The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Informatica, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments.\n\n## Consulting:\n\nConsulting has simplified our focus to center on strategy, experience, technology and operations to make our huge range of capabilities easier for clients to navigate. Today, Consulting competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. We compete with broad-based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.\n\n## Infrastructure:\n\nIBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions for clients' mission-critical and regulated workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of support services and solutions for hybrid cloud infrastructure. Our principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel and original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Further, as-a-Service providers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and regulated workloads.\n\n## Financing:\n\nFinancing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM client's acquisition of IT systems, software and services. Financing's ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.\n\n## Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('Reform Act'). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'expects,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'projects,' and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. 'Risk Factors' on pages 3 to 10 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in the company's filings with the SEC or in materials incorporated therein by reference.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services.

      "answer": "Apple's App Store revenue model depends heavily on third-party content providers, with developers retaining most of the revenue while Apple keeps a commission. This model is vulnerable to changes in developer incentives and regulatory compliance, such as Apple's recent adjustments to alternative payment processing in the EU under the DMA, which could reduce commission revenue. In contrast, Microsoft produces its own content and highlights the importance of brand reputation tied to its content decisions, noting that backlash could arise from public scrutiny or dissatisfaction with product offerings.

There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products. If  third-party  software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relativ e benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and X box for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly , and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the A pp Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the A pp Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within  an  application.  From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS A pp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the A pp Store and Safari in the European Union ('EU') as it seeks to comply with the Digital M arkets A ct (the 'DM A '), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. Changes to the Company's products and services could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced A pp Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. \u00ae\n\n## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relativ ely  short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our env ironmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, gov ernment entities, adv ocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions, public policy positions, or corporate philanthropic initiativ es. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n\n- The introduction of new features, products, serv ices, or terms of serv ice that customers, users, or partners do not like.\n- Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user priv acy, data practices, content, or dev elopment and deployment of AI.\n- Data security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of partners or indiv idual employees.\n\nSocial media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negativ e brand ev ents. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could adv ersely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\n\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adv ersely affect our results of operations. If demand for PCs, serv ers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our results of operations may be adv ersely affected.\n\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensiv e partner and retail network. OEMs building dev ices that run our software hav e also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and serv ices they hav e purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receiv able may increase.\n\nWe maintain an inv estment portfolio of v arious holdings, types, and maturities. These inv estments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or ev ents that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our inv estment portfolio comprises U.S. gov ernment securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. gov ernment credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on gov ernment debt, our inv estment portfolio may be adv ersely affected and we could determine that more of our inv estments hav e experienced a decline in fair v alue, requiring impairment charges that could adv ersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, operations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather ev ent, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic ev ent could cause delays in completing sales, prov iding serv ices, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and dev elopment activ ities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we hav e other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically activ e regions. A catastrophic ev ent that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adv ersely affect our results of operations. Prov iding our customers with more serv ices and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negativ e consequences of prolonged serv ice outages.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our Strategy\n\nThe world is becoming more digital, and computing more pervasive. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the digitization of everything, which is being accelerated by four superpowers: ubiquitous compute, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. Together these superpowers reinforce and amplify one another, and will exponentially increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.\n\nWe are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our software, silicon and platforms, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers, our strategy to win is focused on three key themes: product leadership, open platforms, and manufacturing at scale.\n\n## Our Priorities\n\n## Product Leadership\n\nLead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.\n\nAt our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86 CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application performance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance. Our innovative new 12th Gen client processors (Alder Lake) combine both performance cores and efficient cores in a performance hybrid architecture that can direct workloads to the right core depending on whether they require higher performance or power efficiency. We can also combine these architectural advances with our innovations in process and packaging technology, as in our next-generation Intel Xeon data center CPU (Sapphire Rapids), which will utilize performance cores on multiple compute tiles connected through our EMIB packaging technology in a scalable design, rather than being built on a monolithic silicon die.\n\nBeyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories. Our vision is that our products will help enable a future in which every human can have one petaflop of computing power and one petabyte of data less than one millisecond away.\n\nFundamentals of Our Business",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

      "answer": "Samsung plays a critical role in NVIDIA's supply chain, producing semiconductor wafers for the company (Hop 1). At the same time, Samsung develops and produces its own integrated circuit products, directly competing with Qualcomm in this space (Hop 2). Qualcomm has $12.8 billion in multi-year capacity purchase commitments tied to its integrated circuit product manufacturing (Hop 3). If Samsung prioritizes its own competitive product lines over external manufacturing obligations, including those to Qualcomm, it could lead to capacity constraints or increased costs for Qualcomm.

Our  supply  chain  is  mainly  concentrated  in  the  A sia-Pacific  region.  We  utilize  foundries,  such  as  T aiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSM C, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix Inc., M icron T echnology , Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly , testing and packaging of our final products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,  conformity  to  industry  standard A PIs,  manufacturing  capabilities,  processor  pricing,  and  total  system  costs.  W e  believe  that  our  ability   to  remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver  consistent  volumes  of  our  products  at  acceptable  levels  of  quality   and  at  competitiv e  prices.  W e  ex pect  competition  to  increase  from  both  ex isting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for A I, such as A dv anced M icro Devices, Inc., or A M D, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or A I computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as A libaba Group, A lphabet Inc., A mazon, Inc., or A mazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and M icrosoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n- suppliers of A rm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and M icrosoft;\n- suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as A mbarella, Inc., A M D, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n- networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as A M D, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company , Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and M arvell T echnology , Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally . Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP . The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in A sia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely . We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;",

          "chunk_text": "products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.\n\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while we derive a portion of our revenues from areas outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their ex isting agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver highvolume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest customers (for ex ample, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign, announced in 2015, targeted 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions .'\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (such as its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own",

We have agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets. Such agreements include multi-year capacity purchase commitments with certain suppliers of our integrated circuit products. Total advance payments related to multi-year capacity purchase commitments recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 were $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of which $765 million and $404 million were recorded in other current assets, respectively, and $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion were recorded in other assets, respectively. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments (including those under multi-year capacity purchase commitments to the extent such minimum amounts are both fixed and determinable) for raw materials, semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancellation of outstanding purchase commitments is generally allowed but would require payment of costs incurred through the date of cancellation. Also, in some cases, we may be subject to incremental fees and/or the loss of amounts paid in advance due to capacity underutilization and/or the failure to meet minimum purchase volumes under multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Obligations under our purchase agreements, which primarily relate to integrated circuit product inventory obligations, at September 29, 2024 totaled $12.8 billion of which, $9.6 billion is ex pected to be paid in the nex t 12 months.\n\nOperating Leases.

We will periodically reassess the probability of paying such liquidated damages and recognize changes in the fair value of the underlying liability  through Interest and other, net .\n\n## Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees, which had a balance of $3.3 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($2.9 billion as of December 30, 2023), recorded within other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nWe expensed $541 million in 2024, $272 million in 2023, and $489 million in 2022 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was increased from January 1 through December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 and 2022. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from M arch 1 through December 30, 2023 as compared to 2022.\n\n## US Retiree Medical Plan\n\nUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree M edical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligations were $493 million and $490 million, which used the discount rates of 5.7% and 5.3%. The December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 corresponding fair values of plan assets were $542 million and $548 million. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the US Retiree M edical Plan was in the net asset position.\n\nThe investment strategy for US Retiree M edical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 50% equity and 50% fixed-income investments. A s of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree M edical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:\n\n",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does AMD's reduction in interest expense from convertible debt conversions compare with Nuance's outstanding convertible senior notes liability post-acquisition by Microsoft, and what does this imply about their respective capital structure strategies?",
      "answer": "AMD reduced its interest expense from $47 million in 2020 to $34 million in 2021 due to conversions of its 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, indicating a proactive approach to reducing debt. Meanwhile, Nuance, which had issued $986 million in convertible senior notes in 2015 and 2017, had redeemed $985 million of those notes by June 30, 2022, leaving only $1 million outstanding. Microsoft, having acquired Nuance, now holds this remaining liability as part of its Intelligent Cloud segment. This suggests that AMD focused on reducing debt through voluntary conversions, while Nuance\u2019s strategy under Microsoft involved largely redeeming its convertible notes, reflecting differing capital structure management approaches between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

      "answer": "Accenture (ACN) identifies automation as a key technological area influencing client demand, with its financial results being sensitive to changes in demand for services like automation, AI, and robotics. A reduction in client spending on automation could significantly affect Accenture\u2019s operations. On the other hand, Broadcom (AVGO) directly produces automation solutions as part of its Mainframe Software portfolio, which includes offerings in DevOps, AIOps, and Security. This portfolio is a core component of AVGO\u2019s software business, indicating a structural reliance on automation as a revenue driver. Therefore, while Accenture faces demand-side risk around automation adoption trends, Broadcom has a direct supply-side dependency on automation as part of its mainframe software product suite.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ACN \u2192 Automation: Accenture highlights that its business is exposed to demand volatility based on client adoption of automation and related technologies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Business Risks\n\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOngoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. As described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing, and robotics solutions. As we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nWe are a global technology leader, helping to bring intelligent computing everywhere through the development and commercialization of foundational technologies, including 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and 5G (fifth generation) wireless connectivity, high-performance and low-power computing and on-device artificial intelligence (AI). Our technologies and products have helped power the growth in smartphones and other connected devices. We are scaling our innovations across industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT). We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and through the licensing of our intellectual property, including patents and other rights.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results of Qualcomm, its subsidiaries and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary (Note 2). Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFinancial Statement Preparation. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Examples of our significant accounting estimates and policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others include: the estimation of sales-based royalty revenues; the impairment of non-marketable equity investments; the valuation of inventories; the impairment of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the recognition, measurement and disclosure of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings; and the calculation of our income tax provision, including the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nFiscal Year. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks, and fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Our fiscal year for 2025 will include 52 weeks.\n\nCash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds and notes and certain bank time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities and governmentrelated securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\n\nMarketable Securities. Marketable securities include marketable equity securities, available-for-sale debt securities and, from time-to-time, certain time deposits. We classify marketable securities as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with all realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable equity securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\nIf a debt security has an unrealized loss and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, we record an impairment charge to investment and other income (expense), net for the entire amount of the unrealized loss and adjust the amortized cost basis of the security. For the remaining debt securities, if an unrealized loss ex ists, we separate the impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factors and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factors. Unrealized gains or unrealized losses that are not related to credit factors on available-forsale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes. Unrealized losses that are related to credit loss factors on available-for-sale debt securities and subsequent adjustments to the credit loss are recorded as an allowance for credit losses, which is included in investment and other income (expense), net. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we consider a variety of factors, including the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; the security's relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; the market and economy in general; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates.\n\nEquity Method and Non-marketable Equity Investments. Equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which we have significant influence, but not control, over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for under the equity method. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments are recorded in investment and other income (expense), net. We eliminate unrealized profit or loss related to transactions with equity method investees in relation to our ownership interest in the investee, which is recorded as a component of equity in net earnings (losses) in investees in investment and other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity investments (for which we do not have significant influence or control) are investments without readily determinable fair values that are generally recorded based on initial cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar securities, if any. All gains and losses on investments in non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in investment and other income (expense), net. We monitor equity method and non-marketable equity investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee's financial condition and business forecasts and lower",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forwardlooking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled 'Forward-Looking Information' and 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.\n\nThe following section generally discusses fiscal 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as certain fiscal 2023 items. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\n\n## Overview\n\nSalesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management ('CRM') technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence ('AI'), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform.\n\nOur platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry.\n\nWe continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average.\n\nIn addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are ex pected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies.\n\n## Highlights from Fiscal 2025\n\n- Revenue: For fiscal 2025, revenue was $37.9 billion, an increase of nine percent year-over-year.\n- Income from Operations: For fiscal 2025, income from operations was $7.2 billion as compared to $5.0 billion from a year ago. Operating margin, which represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue, increased to approximately 19 percent for fiscal 2025 compared to approximately 14 percent in the prior year.\n- Net Income per Share: For fiscal 2025, diluted net income per share was $6.36 as compared to diluted net income per share of $4.20 from a year ago.",

      "question": "How does the reliance of Texas Instruments (TXN) on subcontractors for 40% of its assembly and test services compare with NVIDIA's (NVDA) exposure to third-party manufacturers, given the shared dependency on external production capacity and the risks highlighted by AMD's experience with third-party suppliers?",
      "answer": "Texas Instruments relies on subcontractors for 40% of its assembly and test services, supplementing internal capacity to meet customer demand. This external dependency aligns with NVIDIA\u2019s reliance on third-party manufacturers for semiconductor fabrication, assembly, and testing, which exposes them to risks such as limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, and potential prioritization of other customers. AMD's experience highlights the vulnerability in this model, as their dependence on third-party manufacturers\u2014including GF and ATMP joint ventures\u2014can lead to supply disruptions, capacity constraints, and financial penalties if purchase targets are not met. Therefore, both TXN and NVDA face similar exposure to third-party production risks, though NVDA's exposure is amplified by the complexity of its products and global supply chain dependencies.",

        "Hop 1: TXN \u2192 Subcontractors: Texas Instruments uses subcontractors for 40% of its assembly and test services to supplement internal manufacturing capacity.",

Progress and investments include:\n\n- continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022;\n- purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and\n- planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nTogether, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances.\n\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.\n\n## Inventory\n\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

These  risks  may  increase  as  our  products  are  introduced  into  new  devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial  shipments  could  result  in  failure  to  achieve  market  acceptance,  loss  of  design  wins,  and  harm  to  our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field.  If  a  product liability  claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert  the  efforts  of  our  technical  and  management  personnel  and  harm  our  business.

      "question": "How does AVGO's reliance on OEMs for revenue distribution intersect with INTC's exposure to compulsory licensing regulations, given OEMs' active pursuit of strategies to limit royalty payments?",
      "answer": "AVGO depends heavily on OEMs for product distribution and revenue recognition, with a significant portion of its $10,483 million revenue from China being shipped to OEMs who integrate AVGO's components into devices sold globally. These OEMs actively seek to limit royalty payments through strategies such as lobbying for compulsory licensing, initiating legal challenges, and pushing for changes in IP policies that could weaken patent enforcement. INTC, in turn, is directly subject to compulsory licensing regulations and faces risks from government decisions that mandate IP licensing terms, which could reduce its ability to enforce patent rights and collect royalties. The intersection reveals a systemic vulnerability across the semiconductor ecosystem where OEM-driven IP erosion strategies impact both AVGO\u2019s revenue model (through OEM pressure) and INTC\u2019s IP monetization (through regulatory enforcement).",

Nonetheless, in either event, we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues related to that licensee's product sales until such new license agreement is finalized.\n\n## Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.\n\nFrom time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder's ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.\n\nIn addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their",

Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain countries, and even criminal sanctions.\n\n## We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We rely on IP law-as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others -to protect our IP and IP rights. Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in v arious countries and other geopolitical factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations and governments or courts render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability  to enforce our IP rights under any  of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&amp;D, product development, and marketing could be reduced.\n\nOur licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally  license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications. Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.\n\nThird parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies, investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our reputation or relationship with customers, and disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which injunctions are available for non-competitors. For example, in February 2024, R2 Semiconductor, Inc., a non-practicing entity, was able to obtain an injunction and recall order against us and our customers in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany that, if enforced, could have caused significant potential disruption to our and our customers' businesses in Europe. In the past few years, we have faced costly and lengthy lawsuits across multiple jurisdictions selected by non-practicing entities with well-funded third-party investment support, including most notably the V LSI and R2 litigation, which have resulted in significant adverse judgments and settlements.\n\nWe are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets, confidential information, or end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. A ny such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances, we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a result of IP rights claims, we could:\n\n- pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, penalties, or provide accommodations to customers such as through cash payments or discounts;\n- stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;\n- need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or\n- enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.\n\nThese IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue could be harmed.\n\nWe rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n40",

      "question": "How does Cisco's quality control process for configuring hardware and software combinations compare to AMD's risks associated with third-party manufacturers, particularly in light of potential yield issues and supply constraints impacting product delivery timelines?",
      "answer": "Cisco maintains quality control over its manufacturing process through automated testing, burn-in procedures, and statistical process controls to ensure product reliability when configuring hardware and software combinations to meet customer requirements. However, AMD faces risks related to its dependence on third-party manufacturers like TSMC, which could fail to meet supply demands or achieve acceptable manufacturing yields\u2014specifically for products at 7 nm or smaller nodes. These yield issues and supply constraints could result in product delivery delays, lost sales, and a material adverse effect on AMD\u2019s business. Thus, while Cisco exerts control over quality through its configured manufacturing process, AMD\u2019s exposure to third-party manufacturing risks\u2014such as yield fluctuations and capacity limitations\u2014creates a more vulnerable supply chain dynamic.",

        "Hop 2: Quality Control \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: AMD\u2019s reliance on third-party manufacturers like TSMC for wafer fabrication introduces risks related to manufacturing yields and supply constraints.",
        "Hop 3: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2190 AMD: AMD specifically notes that if TSMC cannot manufacture wafers at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities, it could materially affect its business and product delivery timelines."

      "answer": "AMD faces direct regulatory risk from the EU AI Act, which was adopted in 2024 and will be phased in over the next few years, potentially limiting its ability to offer certain AI products and services in European markets. This evolving regulatory environment increases AMD's compliance costs and liability risks. On the other hand, AVGO is exposed to cybersecurity threats stemming from AI advancements, particularly 'deep fake' impersonation and generative automation, which could lead to more sophisticated cyberattacks targeting its systems or those of its partners. These AI-driven threats are compounded by AVGO's role as a critical vendor in digital infrastructure, making it a potential target for nation-state actors. The GS evidence explicitly links AI technology to more advanced cyberattack methods, directly tying AMD's regulatory challenges and AVGO's cybersecurity risks to the same underlying AI technology evolution.",

For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that hav e enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor dev ices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less fav orable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inv entory. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are dev eloping or hav e finalized market entry or public  procurement  regulations  for  computers  and  serv ers  based  on  ENERGY  STAR  specifications,  and  the  like,  as  well  as  additional  energy consumption limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adv ersely affect us. We incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other jurisdictions  are  dev eloping  new  policies  focused  on  conflict  minerals  that  may  impact  and  increase  the  cost  of  our  compliance  program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently v erify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as 'conflict free.' If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections.\n\nIn addition to our Company, customers, gov ernments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. Sev eral customers hav e also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we hav e a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and av oid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our  suppliers  will  always  be  in  conformance  with  laws  and  expectations.  Our  failure  to  satisfy  customer  expectations  on  forced  and  trafficked  labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor's product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.\n\nIn addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  gov ernments.  T he  GDPR  imposes  significant  requirements  on  how  we  collect,  process  and  transfer  personal  data,  as  well  as significant fines for non-compliance.\n\nNew emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with ev olv ing regulations and industry standards. Giv en the complexity and rapid development of AI, there are v arious current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and serv ices. For example, the EU AI  Act  was  adopted  in  2024  and  its  implementation  will  be  phased  in  ov er  the  next  few  years.  In  other  jurisdictions,  similar  legislation  is  being considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and serv ices in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. We expect that the legal and regulatory env ironment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to dev elop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results  of  operations.  Gov ernments  are  also  considering  the  new  issues  in  intellectual  property  law  that AI  creates,  which  could  result  in  different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and dev elopment processes and procedures and could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that relies upon 'deep fake' impersonation technology or other forms of generative automation that may scale up the efficiency or effectiveness of cyber threat activity.\n\nAs a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both governmental entities and critical infrastructure operators, we and our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems supporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the l i kel i hood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure.\n\nAccidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers and business partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software have in the past exposed, and could in the future expose, us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any regulatory non-compliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor's failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages.\n\nDespite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks and unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks or those of our service providers or business partners. Although no such cybersecurity incidents have been material to us, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future. Businesses we acquire have previously increased, and may continue to increase, the scope and complexity of our IT networks, and this has, from time to time, increased our risk exposure to cyber-attacks when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support operations for the acquired businesses.\n\nIn addition, certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and other trusted partners reliably safeguarding secrets (e.g., application credentials) and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle such secrets or adhere to such policies and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in a material cyber incident. Our logging, alerting and cyber incident detection mechanisms may not cover every system potentially targeted by threat actors, may not have the capability to detect certain types of unauthorized activities, and may not capture and surface information sufficient to enable us to timely detect and take responsive action to insider or external threats.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as well as customers and service providers, have also increased their focus on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions concerning privacy, cybersecurity, secure technology development, data governance, data protection, confidentiality and IP could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties and may also increase our overall compliance burden. See also ' Failure of our software products to manage and security IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.'\n\nThe majority of our sales have historically come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have historically depended on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract manufacturers ('CMs') and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For fiscal year 2024, sales to distributors accounted for 48% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to our top five end customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2024. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by these customers.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA generates 84% of its revenue from international sales, which heavily depends on third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S. to fabricate, assemble, test, and package its semiconductor wafers. This dependence introduces risks such as supply chain disruptions, limited control over delivery schedules, and potential quality issues. These third-party manufacturers, in turn, rely on subcontractors for specific production tasks, introducing another layer of risk in terms of capacity allocation and production delays. Similarly, Accenture increasingly depends on subcontractors for large, complex client engagements\u2014especially those involving cloud transformation and integration of new technologies\u2014where subcontractors must deliver services on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. Accenture highlights that subcontractor performance issues could lead to execution risks, including delays, cost overruns, and client dissatisfaction. Both companies face material adverse effects due to third-party execution risks, though NVIDIA's exposure is rooted in hardware manufacturing while Accenture's is tied to service delivery ecosystems.",

These  risks  may  increase  as  our  products  are  introduced  into  new  devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. An error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial  shipments  could  result  in  failure  to  achieve  market  acceptance,  loss  of  design  wins,  and  harm  to  our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field.  If  a  product liability  claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert  the  efforts  of  our  technical  and  management  personnel  and  harm  our  business.  Further,  our  business  liability insurance  may  be  inadequate  or  future  coverage  may  be  unavailable  on  acceptable  terms,  which  could  adversely impact our financial results.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\nWe  are  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  associated  with  international  operations,  including  adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business.\n\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\n- domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\n- differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\n- domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\n- disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "We are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business, all in a compressed timeframe. The scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic, social and political conditions. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations.\n\nThe overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex. The European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. Countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered. Individual countries across the globe and the European Union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), a global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The OECD proposals aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users, and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and, if enacted, the extent of their impact. The increased focus of the European Commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws (or in their interpretation or enforcement) around the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.",

      "answer": "TSMC's capacity constraints in producing 7nm and smaller wafers could delay AMD's product roadmap timelines, as the company focuses its 7nm and lower node microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC cannot manufacture wafers in sufficient quantities to meet demand, AMD may face product delivery delays and increased production costs. Similarly, NVDA relies on foundries like TSMC to transition to smaller geometry process technologies, such as advanced process node technologies, which are critical for manufacturing next-generation products. If TSMC experiences delays or fails to implement these technologies successfully, NVDA could face challenges in scaling its supply chain, meeting customer demand, and maintaining competitive product performance. Both companies are exposed to the same manufacturing risks due to their shared dependency on TSMC and other foundries, which could affect their ability to deliver products on schedule and maintain market share.",

      "answer": "Accenture states that a very significant portion of its revenue and services are based on technology or software provided by a few major ecosystem partners. If these partners experience service disruptions\u2014such as cybersecurity incidents like the one Microsoft disclosed involving unauthorized access to internal systems and customer data\u2014Accenture could face delivery inefficiencies or fail to meet service level agreements, which it explicitly notes could materially impact profitability. Microsoft's cybersecurity incident, which involved unauthorized access to email accounts and source code repositories, could disrupt its ability to provide secure and timely services, which in turn could hinder Accenture's ability to deliver solutions that depend on Microsoft's infrastructure or software, thereby affecting Accenture's financial performance.",

Indiv idual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT, and we hav e experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors hav e gained unauthorized access to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide v ariety of methods, which include dev eloping and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential v ulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and serv ices or gain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose sensitiv e information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For example, as prev iously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late Nov ember 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor used and may continue to use information it obtained to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor may utilize this information to otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm to our reputation and customer relationships. Additionally, we may discov er additional impacts of this or other incidents as part of our ongoing examination of this incident. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activ ities for extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nationstate attacks against us, our customers, or our partners hav e and may continue to intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Cyber incidents and attacks, indiv idually or in the aggregate, could adv ersely affect our financial condition, results of operations, competitiv e position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.\n\nInadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we hav e acquired or those of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data, in the future. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remov e employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users' security or systems or rev eal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n\nCyberthreats are constantly ev olv ing and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning. We may hav e no current capability to detect certain v ulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the env ironment ov er long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to inv estigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access to other networks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can hav e cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those of our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to inv estigate and evaluate the full impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to prov ide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to prov ide serv ices to our customers and protect the priv acy of their data, result in product dev elopment delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improv e technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adv ersely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our serv ices.",

      "answer": "AVGO faces significant risk from the volatility of AI-related semiconductor demand, as highlighted by its dependence on hyperscale customers and the cyclical nature of the industry, which could result in revenue shortfalls if AI adoption slows. Meanwhile, ACN anticipates substantial costs to align its AI services with emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act and U.S. Executive Order on AI, which could constrain deployment and adoption rates. Since both companies operate in overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and serve markets affected by AI deployment trends, tightening AI regulations may simultaneously depress AVGO\u2019s hardware sales and increase ACN\u2019s service delivery costs, creating a dual pressure point in the broader AI ecosystem.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption  of  AI,  and  thus  our  business.  T hird-party  misuse  of  AI  applications,  models,  or  solutions,  or  ineffectiv e  or  inadequate  AI  dev elopment  or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to indiv iduals or society and impair the public's acceptance of AI. Moreov er, we may be subject to competitiv e harm, regulatory action and legal liability as a result of new and proposed legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing  data  protection,  priv acy  and  intellectual  property  and  other  laws.  Such  regulations  and  changes  thereto  could  cause  us  to  incur  greater compliance costs, could impact our ability to sell or the ability of our customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our AI-related products and serv ices and reduce the number of customers, which could negativ ely impact our business and financial results. As there continues to be an increasing focus on risks related to AI technologies, there may be an increasing focus on regulatory restrictions that target products and serv ices that enable or facilitate AI and that may negativ ely impact some of our AI-related products and serv ices. If the AI-related products that we offer  hav e  unintended  consequences,  infringe  intellectual  property  rights  or  rights  of  publicity,  or  are  misused  by  our  customers  or  are  otherwise controv ersial due to their perceiv ed or actual impact on human rights, priv acy, cybersecurity, employment or other social, economic or political issues the public's acceptance of AI may be impaired and this may also result in reputational, competitiv e and financial harm and liability to our business.\n\n## The agreements governing our notes, our guarantee of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\n\nThe indenture gov erning our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains v arious cov enants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, conv ey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person.\n\nWe unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, X ilinx's obligations under the X ilinx's 2.375% Notes due 2030 (the Assumed X ilinx Notes). The supplemental indenture gov erning the Assumed X ilinx Notes also contain v arious cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or conv ey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person.\n\nWe also have an unsecured revolv ing credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Rev olv ing Credit Agreement). Our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement contains various cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest cov erage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement gov erning our conv ertible notes and our Revolv ing  Credit Agreement  contains  prov isions  whereby  a  payment  default  or  acceleration  under  certain  agreements  with  respect  to  other  material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our conv ertible indenture or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolv ing Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders under our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will hav e sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\n\nAlso,  we  enter  into  sale  and  factoring  arrangements  from  time  to  time  with  respect  to  certain  accounts  receiv ables,  which  arrangements  are  nonrecourse to us in the ev ent that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons and are not included in our indebtedness.

Sev eral jurisdictions where we operate are considering or have proposed or enacted legislation and policies regulating A I and nonpersonal data, such as the European Union's AI Act and the U.S.'s Executive Order on A I. These regulations may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy A I and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients or limit our ability to incorporate certain A I capabilities into our offerings.\n\nWhile we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identify ing or resolv ing issues before they arise. A ny  failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of A I technology in our services and solutions may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such, may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues.\n\n## If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our people with market-leading skills and capabilities in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain people with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. We must hire or reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills, backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or retrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is competition for scarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our people have been directly targeted because of their highly sought-after skills and this will likely continue.\n\nThere is a risk that at certain points in time, as a result of technological developments or changes in demand, we may have more people than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. In these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our workforce, including reducing the rate of new hires and increasing involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of people and skills in balance with client demand. In some countries we are required by local law to consult with employee representative bodies such as works councils, which may constrain our operational flexibility and efficiency in balancing our workforce with client demand and make us less competitive. In addition, while an immaterial percentage of our global workforce is currently unionized, the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational impediments.\n\nAt certain times and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we might need to redeploy existing people or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIf our utiliz ation rate is too high or too low, it could hav e an adv erse effect on employ ee engagement and attrition, the quality  of the work performed as well as our ability  to staff projects.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of A ccenture Leadership with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. We depend on identifying, developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our businesses. This includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in markets where the depth of skilled employees may be limited. Our ability to expand in our key markets depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with critical capabilities.\n\nOur equity-based incentive compensation plans and other variable cash compensation programs, as well as promotions, are designed to reward high-performing individuals for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives or the pace of promotions does not materialize because of company performance or volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the people we need could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain people could be negatively affected.",

Adobe operates in Taiwan as part of its global field offices but does not disclose specific revenue figures for Taiwan alone. Adobe's primary revenue model is subscription-based, with most products offered through software subscriptions that provide access to the latest versions, contrasting with Apple's product-centric model where revenue is derived largely from hardware and software sales. This makes a direct revenue-to-operating-income comparison complex, but it highlights differing financial exposures to the region: Apple's segment-level profitability reflects its tangible product sales and supply chain dynamics, while Adobe's presence supports a recurring revenue model with higher gross margins and lower regional financial volatility.",

      "answer": "Microsoft depends on third-party manufacturers for device production, some of which use a limited number of subcontractors for critical components, creating risks around supply continuity, quality assurance, and capacity allocation. For example, disruptions at these suppliers could lead to delays in Microsoft's ability to meet consumer demand. Similarly, Accenture relies on subcontractors and third-party vendors to deliver products and services in large, complex client engagements, particularly in compressed transformational projects involving cloud migration and technology updates. Accenture's profitability and execution depend on these subcontractors' ability to deliver on time, at cost, and according to project requirements. Both companies face operational inflexibility and dependency risks, but Microsoft's exposure is rooted in hardware manufacturing constraints, while Accenture's is tied to service delivery complexity and integration challenges with third-party providers.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  ('GAAP'),  and  growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud  services  metrics  and  changes  to  align  with  how  we  manage  our  Windows  OEM  and  Search  and  news  advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&amp;A.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "We are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business, all in a compressed timeframe. The scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic, social and political conditions. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations.\n\nThe overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex. The European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. Countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered. Individual countries across the globe and the European Union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), a global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The OECD proposals aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users, and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and, if enacted, the extent of their impact. The increased focus of the European Commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws (or in their interpretation or enforcement) around the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.",

      "answer": "AMD reported $1,841 million in sales to external customers from Taiwan in 2023, highlighting the region's significance in its revenue distribution. Meanwhile, NVIDIA explicitly states that its foundry partners\u2014critical to its chipset supply\u2014are primarily located in Taiwan, and a significant or prolonged geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent NVIDIA from receiving chipset supply. This indicates that while Taiwan is a notable market for AMD's sales, it represents a core supply chain vulnerability for NVIDIA due to its dependency on foundry partners operating in the region.",

Meanwhile, Broadcom has defined benefit pension plans covering employees in Taiwan, suggesting a long-term operational commitment and associated liabilities in the same geography. While Apple's metric reflects top-line performance driven by customer demand, Broadcom's obligations reflect employee-related costs and retirement liabilities, highlighting two distinct financial dimensions of operating in Taiwan and its broader regional context.",

'Stockholders' Equity,' as their effect was antidilutive.\n\n## 9. Retirement Plans\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified pension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-permonth program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

          "chunk_text": "governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,' ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,' 'A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,' ' There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,' and 'Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.'\n\nRegulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. In addition, and especially in developing regulatory areas (for example, AI, privacy and data protection, and ESG-related reporting), Regulations may differ by country or by state within the United States, and may be conflicting in certain cases. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## There are risks associated with our debt.\n\nOur outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital ex penditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flex ibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our debt depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\n\n## Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to ex amination of our tax  returns and reports by tax ing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well as countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.\n\nTax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax  rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax  rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, both of which have been proposed by the current U.S. presidential administration, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. Further, if the requirement to capitalize certain research and development expenditures for federal income tax purposes is changed, as has been proposed by Congress, this would negatively affect our provision for income taxes and results of operations (although it would have a favorable impact on our cash flows from operations due to lower cash tax payments).\n\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, representing a coalition of member countries, has made certain changes, including the Pillar Two framework, which imposes a minimum tax of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. The OECD is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, if and as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Item 1B.

      "question": "How does Microsoft's approach to technical support offerings compare with Cisco's financing arrangements for technical support, particularly in terms of Cisco's $53 million credit loss allowance for loan receivables as of July 29, 2023?",
      "answer": "Microsoft offers technical support as part of its broader portfolio of software, services, and devices aimed at empowering organizations and individuals (Hop 1). Cisco, on the other hand, finances its technical support and advanced services through loan receivables, which are typically short-term arrangements averaging one to three years (Hop 2). As of July 29, 2023, Cisco disclosed a $53 million credit loss allowance specifically for these loan receivables, indicating the financial provision made for potential defaults in their technical support financing programs (Hop 3). This comparison highlights different strategic approaches: Microsoft integrates technical support into its product ecosystem, while Cisco directly finances such services through structured loan arrangements, with an associated risk profile reflected in their credit loss allowance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption  of  AI,  and  thus  our  business.  T hird-party  misuse  of  AI  applications,  models,  or  solutions,  or  ineffectiv e  or  inadequate  AI  dev elopment  or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to indiv iduals or society and impair the public's acceptance of AI.

Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

      "answer": "Of AVGO's $24,156 million developed technology intangible asset from the VMware acquisition, a 'significant portion' is tied to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), with $4,705 million of in-process R&D also directly attributed to VCF. While the exact percentage is not specified, the emphasis on VCF within the developed technology valuation indicates a major strategic focus. In comparison, AMD reported a gross carrying amount of $13,390 million for developed technology as of December 30, 2023, which represents a key component of its intangible asset base. This suggests that while both companies value developed technology highly, AVGO's acquisition-driven strategy places a concentrated emphasis on VCF as a core asset within its broader VMware-related intangible portfolio.",

      "question": "What would be the potential financial obligation for AMD if a change of control event triggered repurchase rights for holders of the 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032, and how does this compare to the semi-annual interest payment schedule established at issuance?",
      "answer": "If a change of control event occurred, AMD would be obligated to repurchase the 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032 at 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Given that AMD issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of these notes, this would result in a potential cash outflow of $1.01 billion. This repurchase obligation contrasts with AMD's established semi-annual interest payment schedule, which commenced on December 1, 2022, and requires interest payments twice per year on June 1 and December 1. The repurchase obligation upon a change of control is significantly larger in magnitude than the regular interest payments, which are calculated based on the 3.924% coupon rate applied to the $1.0 billion principal.",

      "answer": "AMD's ability to generate revenue from x86-based microprocessor sales is directly tied to Microsoft's continued development and support of operating systems that work with AMD's x86 instruction set. If Microsoft discontinues this support, independent software providers may avoid designing applications for AMD's architecture, and customers may not purchase PCs with AMD products. This risk is amplified because Microsoft categorizes operating systems as part of its product revenue, which includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, and other software.

We compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, our global reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n\nAs of October 30, 2022, we had 17,035 U.S. and other patents and 618 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.\n\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.\n\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop noninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.\n\nWith respect to our infrastructure software, the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

      "answer": "Saudi Arabia's implementation of data localization requirements mandates that data be stored and processed within the country, which Adobe notes could adversely impact its international business operations. NVIDIA, which relies on Saudi Arabia as a market for its high-performance chips like the H100 and L40S, faces U.S. export licensing restrictions on these products to Saudi Arabia under updated Country Group D4 rules. Since these chips require U.S. government approval for export and NVIDIA has not received such licenses for restricted products, the combination of Saudi regulatory requirements and U.S. export controls could significantly limit NVIDIA's ability to serve Saudi customers with these advanced AI chips, potentially reducing its market access and revenue opportunities in the region.",

In addition, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.\n\nWe have not prevailed, and may not in the future prevail, in every lawsuit or dispute. For further information about specific litigation and proceedings, see the section titled 'Legal Proceedings' contained in Part II, Item 8, Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.\n\n## We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.\n\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These local, state, federal and international laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade laws such as import and export controls, anti-boycott, economic sanctions and embargoes, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, consumer protection, records management, usergenerated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, AI regulations, corporate governance, antitrust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and evolving, and may at times conflict. Further, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, which may conflict with local customs and practices in other foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies where it is common to engage in practices that would be prohibited under such laws. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, business partners and vendors will not take actions in violation of our internal policies, U.S. laws or other applicable international laws. Compliance with the above laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require additional changes to our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.\n\nIn  addition,  approx imately  50%  of  our  employees  are  located  outside  the  United  States. Accordingly,  we  are  ex posed  to  changes  in  laws  governing  our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.\n\n## Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws and regulatory requirements could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.\n\nWe are subject to global data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that relate to our various business units and data processing activities, which may include sensitive, confidential, and personal information. These laws, regulations and codes are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. G overnment officials and regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, including the transferring of personal information across international borders. This scrutiny can result in new and shifting interpretations of ex isting laws, thereby further impacting our business. For ex ample, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated and litigated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (for ex ample, Standard Contractual Clauses and the EU - US Data Privacy Framework) are the subject of legal challenge, regulatory interpretation and judicial decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Several other countries, including but not limited to the United States, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and certain countries have also established specific legal requirements for data localization (such as where personal data must remain stored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers' business, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions. Additionally, the G eneral Data Protection Regulation in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom continues to be interpreted by European and UK courts in novel ways leading to shifting requirements, country-specific differences in application and uncertain enforcement priorities. Laws in Asia, such as the Personal Information Protection Law in China and developing laws in India, as well as state laws in the United States on privacy, data and related technologies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Colorado Privacy Act and the V irginia Consumer Data Protection Act, as well as industry self-regulatory codes and regulatory requirements, create additional privacy and security compliance obligations and expand the scope of potential liability, either jointly or severally with our customers and suppliers. Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, G overnance, and Incident Disclosure requires us to make certain disclosures related",

For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely in that country or by only domesEc companies.  Some jurisdicEons are currently considering adopEng or have adopted data l oca l i za Eon requirements, which mandate the collecEon, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders.

Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.

In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China's semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and M acau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A 100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A 100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NV IDIA  integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A 100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the M iddle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi A rabia, the United A rab Emirates, and V ietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A 100, A 800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX  4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\n\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A 800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to 'Tier 2' status. The A I Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select 'Universal V erified End Users', or UV EU, and lesser benefits on 'National V erified End Users', or NV EU. The A I Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers  of  cov ered  products  to  Tier  2  countries  and  companies  in  Tier  1  countries  that  are  either  headquartered  in  Tier  2,  or  hav e  an  ultimate  parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers' costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR's licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.",

      "answer": "Apple's business is significantly impacted by geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan, as it relies heavily on outsourcing partners located in Taiwan for manufacturing critical components. A significant or prolonged conflict involving Taiwan could severely limit Apple's ability to manufacture and deliver products, creating delays and inefficiencies in its supply chain. Similarly, NVIDIA depends on foundry partners in Taiwan for chipset supply, and any disruption due to geopolitical tensions could severely limit or prevent NVIDIA from receiving this supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. Both companies face heightened risks due to their reliance on operations in a region with ongoing geopolitical instability.",

      "question": "What percentage of Broadcom's $24,156 million developed technology intangible asset from the VMware acquisition is specifically tied to VMware Cloud Foundation, and how does this compare to Oracle's net value of developed technology as a percentage of its total intangible assets?",
      "answer": "Of Broadcom's $24,156 million developed technology intangible asset from the VMware acquisition, a 'significant portion' is tied to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), though the exact percentage is not disclosed. Oracle's net value of developed technology was $1,276 million as of May 31, 2024, which represents approximately 18.4% of Oracle's total intangible assets of $6,890 million. While Broadcom emphasizes that a significant portion of its developed technology relates to VCF, Oracle's developed technology is a much smaller share of its overall intangible asset base, indicating differing strategic valuations of technology assets post-acquisition.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL \u2192 Developed Technology: Oracle reports $1,276 million net value of developed technology as of May 31, 2024, out of total intangible assets of $6,890 million.",
        "Hop 2: Developed Technology \u2192 VMware Cloud Foundation: Broadcom's $24,156 million developed technology intangible asset includes a 'significant portion' tied to VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), as noted in the acquisition valuation.",

      "answer": "Microsoft's product revenue includes operating systems, which are critical components for PC functionality and software compatibility. AMD relies on Microsoft to design and develop its operating systems to run on or support AMD's x86-based microprocessor and graphics products. If Microsoft does not continue to support AMD's x86 instruction sets or graphics capabilities, independent software vendors may not develop applications optimized for AMD's innovations, and customers may be less inclined to purchase PCs with AMD products. This dependency highlights how Microsoft's inclusion of operating systems in its product revenue indirectly affects AMD's ability to innovate and compete in the market.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.

      "answer": "NVDA depends heavily on third-party manufacturers and generated 84% of its revenue in fiscal year 2022 from international sales, which exposes it to supply chain risks such as production delays, quality issues, and limited control over delivery schedules. This dependency extends to subcontractors, as highlighted by AMD's evidence, which states that third-party manufacturers also rely on subcontractors for manufacturing, assembly, and testing. In comparison, TXN selectively uses subcontractors for 40% of its assembly/test services while maintaining internal manufacturing capacity for the majority of its production needs. This indicates that TXN has a more balanced approach, combining internal control with external flexibility, whereas NVDA is more exposed to external manufacturing risks due to its complete reliance on third-party manufacturers and subcontractors for its global operations.",

        "Hop 2: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2192 Subcontractors: AMD's evidence shows that third-party manufacturers themselves depend on subcontractors for manufacturing, assembly, and testing, and that disruptions at this level\u2014such as capacity constraints, misappropriation of IP, or quality issues\u2014can significantly impact product availability and performance.",
        "Hop 3: Subcontractors \u2190 TXN: TXN selectively uses subcontractors for 40% of its assembly/test services but maintains internal manufacturing capacity for the majority of its production needs, allowing for greater control and flexibility compared to full reliance on external partners."

These  risks  may  increase  as  our  products  are  introduced  into  new  devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "We continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our longterm capacity planning. Progress and investments include:\n\n- continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022;\n- purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and\n- planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025.\n\nTogether, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances.\n\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors.\n\n## Inventory\n\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license.",

The  recast  of  these  prior  period amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated  cash  flows statements.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n## Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the  nature  and  timing  of  satisfaction  of  performance  obligations,  and  determining  the  standalone  selling  price  ('SSP')  of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when  technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn  July  2022,  we  completed  an  assessment  of  the  useful  lives  of  our  server  and  network  equipment.  Due  to  investments  in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.\n\n## Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses  are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications,  business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.",

We do this in service of delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today's complex and unpredictable world.\n\n## Customer Priorities\n\n## Modernize Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure, including through automation to manage and monitor each connection in real time.\n\nWe continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form an integrated architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that simplifies and helps secure networking for customers at scale.\n\nOur  Observability  offerings  collect  and  process  daily  measurements  from  customers'  owned  and  unowned  networks,  providing  automated  insights,  proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers to enable them to reduce mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT productivity and user experience.\n\nFor the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside. We continue to make significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, which we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future.\n\nAs part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions to help them communicate more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.\n\n## Improve Cybersecurity\n\nWith the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point solutions to a platform comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network; and harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk Inc. ('Splunk') to prevent, detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.\n\n## Harness the Power of AI and Data\n\nAI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher requirement for network connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and inference workloads for both webscalers and enterprises. We help to scale our customers' network infrastructure with high-density routers and  switches,  improved  network  management,  and  high-performance  optics.  We  are  reinventing  data  center  operations  for  our  customers  by  simplifying  the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.\n\nWe can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their own business data. With this breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights and contex t to customers, leading them to more informed proactive decisions and better business results.\n\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with our  Strategy and  Priorities, see 'Item 1A.  Risk  Factors,' including the risk factor entitled 'We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.' For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn  October 2023, BIS issued new requirements for certain adv anced computing items that apply to the export of products classified ECCN 3A090 or 4A090 to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, any of Country Groups D1, D4 or D5, including China. These controls prev ent us from shipping certain AMD Instinct\u2122 integrated circuits and certain AMD Versal\u2122 FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China), without a license. These controls also require us to file a  Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) notification with BIS 25 days before shipping certain Versal FPGAs to China, or to customers outside of the United States whose ultimate parent is headquartered in a D5 country (including China). The NAC notification process could result in BIS prohibiting a shipment or requiring  a  license  application  before  shipping  a  product  that  is  the  subject  of  a  NAC  notification.  BIS  may  issue  new  licensing  requirements  and regulatory controls in the future. Ev en new products that fall below the licensing thresholds may not be successful because we hav e no assurances BIS will agree that the alternativ e products are not subject to the new licensing requirements or that future regulations will not control the alternativ e products. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions, or retaliatory actions from foreign governments could result  in  lost  sales  adv ersely  impacting  our  reputation  and  business.  T here  is  also  a  possibility  of  future  tariffs,  trade  protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our current and future products, customers, or suppliers by the United States, China or other countries that could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business. New export control restrictions may adv ersely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. In addition, deemed export restrictions could further affect our ability to prov ide serv ices or dev elop products in the United States.\n\nUnited States export control regulations include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain AI technologies to United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, gov ernments, persons and entities. If there are changes to those regulations, or to the categorization of our products under those regulations, our ability to sell our products and serv ices outside the United States may be harmed. The United States and its allies continue to focus on export restrictions targeting semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products and serv ices. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and in the future is likely to further adopt other unilateral or multilateral controls. The scope and application of such controls hav e been and may again be v ery broad, which may prohibit us from exporting or prov iding access to our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negativ ely impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to meet demand abroad. If these export controls targeting semiconductors associated with AI including GPUs and associated products and serv ices are further tightened, our ability to export our technology, products or serv ices could be further restricted. We may be at a competitiv e disadv antage if our competitors are not subject to the same or similar restrictions. Additionally, such export controls hav e, and may in the future, subject downstream recipients of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair or transfer of our products and may hav e a material adv erse effect on us.\n\nWe may, from time to time, receiv e technical data from third parties that is subject to the International T raffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  Export Administration  Regulation  (EAR)  gov erns  the  export  and  re-export  of  certain AMD  products, including FPGAs, as well as the transfer of related technologies or prov ision of serv ices, whether in the U.S. or abroad. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when or pursuant to which conditions they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. When we file license applications or Notification Adv anced Computing (NAC) exception notices we hav e no assurance that BIS will grant any exemptions or licenses or that the BIS will act on the filings in a timely manner. Ev en if BIS grants a requested license, the license may come with burdensome conditions that we cannot or decide not to fulfill. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export priv ileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractiv e to ov erseas customers, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\n\n## If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positiv e and negativ e ev idence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",

The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NV L 72 and NV L 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. A dditionally , we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG's export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of A I and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the M iddle East and countries designated 'Tier 2' by the A I Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly , could impact our ability  to dev elop and supply  solutions for our automotive customers.\n\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the A sia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

In contrast, MSFT reported $44.9 billion in foreign income before taxes in fiscal 2024, which could be subject to top-up taxes under Pillar Two if earned in jurisdictions with effective tax rates below 15%.

      "question": "How does Cisco's credit loss allowance for loan receivables tied to technical support services compare to Salesforce's reliance on third-party technical support providers, given both companies' exposure to service delivery risks?",
      "answer": "Cisco reported a $53 million credit loss allowance for loan receivables as of July 29, 2023, which includes financing arrangements specifically related to technical support services provided to customers. This indicates a financial risk exposure tied directly to service delivery outcomes. Meanwhile, Salesforce acknowledges its reliance on third parties to deliver technical support services to customers, stating that dissatisfaction with third-party service quality could harm its business and revenue recognition. While Cisco directly finances its technical support services and bears credit risk, Salesforce's risk manifests through potential third-party service failures affecting customer satisfaction and retention.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CRM \u2192 Technical Support Services: Salesforce depends on third parties for delivering technical support services and acknowledges that third-party service failures could harm its business and revenue recognition.",

Our adoption of or failure to adopt, as well as the manner and time of, changes to our pricing and packaging models and strategies may harm our business.\n\n## We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\n\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success, and changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives may be disruptive to our business. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business.\n\nThe technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and technology services, as well as competition for sales ex ecutives, data scientists and operations personnel. We have experienced challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining such talent. We have ex perienced and ex pect to continue to ex perience difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. Additionally, our compensation arrangements and benefits may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating our existing personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\n\nIn January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth, which included a reduction of our workforce and office space reductions within certain markets. The workforce reduction was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024, and real estate actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. Additionally, throughout fiscal 2025 we initiated further targeted workforce and office space reductions. These restructuring actions, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees.\n\nIn addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family. As our organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including workforce and office space reductions related to our restructuring actions, we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties maintaining our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of communicating with all employees. Any inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers or negatively impact our future growth.\n\n## Any failure in the delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services related to our online applications may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\n\nOur customers sometimes require highly skilled and trained service professionals to successfully implement our applications and depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. Implementation services may be performed by us, our customers, a third party, or a combination thereof. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, our revenue recognition could be impacted and the customer's dissatisfaction with the services received could negatively impact our ability to sell our other offerings to that customer or retain ex isting customers. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain high-quality professional and technical support services could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to ex isting and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.\n\n## Strategic and Industry Risks\n\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.",

Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks and challenges and may result in unintended consequences that could affect its further development or our and our customers' adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations also presents further risks, costs, and challenges. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical  and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise.  The AI-related legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could also give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of new applications of ex isting data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; damage our reputation; or otherwise materially harm our business.\n\n## We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\n\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the  United  States.  Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are negatively impacted by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we ex perienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.'",

The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that hav e enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor dev ices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less fav orable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inv entory. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are dev eloping or hav e finalized market entry or public  procurement  regulations  for  computers  and  serv ers  based  on  ENERGY  STAR  specifications,  and  the  like,  as  well  as  additional  energy consumption limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adv ersely affect us. We incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other jurisdictions  are  dev eloping  new  policies  focused  on  conflict  minerals  that  may  impact  and  increase  the  cost  of  our  compliance  program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently v erify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as 'conflict free.' If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections.\n\nIn addition to our Company, customers, gov ernments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. Sev eral customers hav e also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we hav e a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and av oid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our  suppliers  will  always  be  in  conformance  with  laws  and  expectations.  Our  failure  to  satisfy  customer  expectations  on  forced  and  trafficked  labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor's product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.\n\nIn addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  gov ernments.  T he  GDPR  imposes  significant  requirements  on  how  we  collect,  process  and  transfer  personal  data,  as  well  as significant fines for non-compliance.\n\nNew emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with ev olv ing regulations and industry standards. Giv en the complexity and rapid development of AI, there are v arious current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and serv ices. For example, the EU AI  Act  was  adopted  in  2024  and  its  implementation  will  be  phased  in  ov er  the  next  few  years.  In  other  jurisdictions,  similar  legislation  is  being considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and serv ices in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. We expect that the legal and regulatory env ironment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to dev elop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results  of  operations.  Gov ernments  are  also  considering  the  new  issues  in  intellectual  property  law  that AI  creates,  which  could  result  in  different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and dev elopment processes and procedures and could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "The implementation of the EU AI Act through 2030 could significantly impact Adobe\u2019s ability to monetize AI innovations like Adobe Firefly by increasing compliance, governance, and research and development costs. This regulatory burden may delay or halt development, require costly changes to AI offerings, or force Adobe to alter monetization strategies. Simultaneously, the increased regulatory scrutiny of AI could reduce demand for AI-related products, including Broadcom\u2019s custom AI accelerators and XPUs, which are central to their semiconductor business. If demand for such products declines due to regulatory restrictions, Broadcom may face reduced revenue and profitability in its AI-related product lines. This regulatory pressure, combined with potential market hesitancy, could create a broader chilling effect on AI adoption, indirectly harming Adobe\u2019s ability to successfully monetize its AI innovations.",

Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption  of  AI,  and  thus  our  business.  T hird-party  misuse  of  AI  applications,  models,  or  solutions,  or  ineffectiv e  or  inadequate  AI  dev elopment  or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to indiv iduals or society and impair the public's acceptance of AI.

Our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement contains various cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest cov erage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement gov erning our conv ertible notes and our Revolv ing  Credit Agreement  contains  prov isions  whereby  a  payment  default  or  acceleration  under  certain  agreements  with  respect  to  other  material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our conv ertible indenture or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolv ing Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

      "question": "How does the change in Cisco's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables tied to hardware financing compare to Microsoft's revenue recognition approach for hardware that is similarly interdependent with software, and what does this reveal about their respective financial exposures to integrated hardware-software offerings?",
      "answer": "Cisco's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables tied to hardware financing decreased from $103 million in fiscal year 2022 to $53 million in fiscal year 2023, indicating a reduction in expected defaults on financing extended for hardware sales. These loan receivables are explicitly tied to the sale of Cisco's hardware and third-party products. Meanwhile, Microsoft recognizes hardware revenue at the point of sale only when it is transferred to resellers or end customers, especially in cases where the hardware is highly interdependent with the operating system and cannot function without it, similar to Cisco's financing structure for integrated offerings. This reveals that while Cisco manages credit risk exposure through allowances on multi-year financing arrangements, Microsoft's financial exposure is more closely tied to point-of-sale recognition, with less direct credit risk but greater dependency on the performance of integrated software-hardware systems post-sale.",

      "answer": "QCOM expects minimal impact from the Global Minimum Tax starting in fiscal year 2025, as it does not operate materially in jurisdictions with tax rates below the 15% Pillar Two minimum. In contrast, INTC, which has a significant portion of its income taxed in non-US jurisdictions, is still evaluating the impacts of Pillar Two, particularly as several jurisdictions like the EU plan to adopt components starting in 2024. Both companies monitor Pillar Two developments closely, but INTC faces more immediate uncertainty due to its broader international tax footprint and ongoing legislative adoptions in key markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 Global Minimum Tax: QCOM states that Pillar Two will apply to it starting in fiscal year 2025, but it does not expect a material impact due to limited operations in low-tax jurisdictions.",
        "Hop 2: Global Minimum Tax \u2192 Pillar Two Model Rules: The Pillar Two Model Rules set a global minimum tax rate of 15%, with implementation beginning in 2024 in several jurisdictions, though the U.S. has not yet adopted them.",
        "Hop 3: Pillar Two Model Rules \u2190 INTC: INTC notes that many non-US jurisdictions where it operates are adopting Pillar Two components starting in 2024, and it is actively evaluating the impact of these rules on its global tax liabilities."

      "answer": "Cisco's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased significantly from $103 million in 2022 to $53 million in 2023, indicating a reduced financial risk in their financing arrangements tied to hardware, software, and services\u2014including technical support. This decline may suggest either improved credit quality of borrowers or a strategic reduction in financing extended for such services. Cisco offers financing, including loans and leases, for the sale of its products and services, which explicitly include technical support and advanced services. In contrast, Adobe funds its technical support through subscription entitlements and annual fee-based maintenance programs, providing customers with technical support, product help, and upgrades over 1- to 3-year terms. Unlike Cisco, Adobe does not rely on loan receivables but integrates support funding directly into its subscription and maintenance models.",

      "answer": "A prolonged geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan could severely disrupt both NVIDIA's and Qualcomm's supply chains, as both companies rely heavily on foundry partners located in Taiwan for critical semiconductor manufacturing. NVIDIA has explicitly stated that challenges in estimating demand could be exacerbated by geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China, which are significant to their revenue and supply continuity. Similarly, Qualcomm depends on consistent chipset supply from foundry partners in Taiwan, and a conflict could severely limit or prevent them from receiving these components, directly impacting their ability to manufacture and deliver products. Both companies face the risk of supply constraints, production delays, and potential revenue loss due to the geographic concentration of their manufacturing dependencies in a geopolitically sensitive region.",

      "question": "How does the impact of the OECD's Pillar Two Model Rules on Intel's non-US tax benefits compare to Microsoft's exposure under the global minimum tax, given the differences in their international tax strategies?",
      "answer": "Intel's tax benefits have increased due to a higher proportion of income taxed in non-US jurisdictions, and the company is actively evaluating the impact of Pillar Two Model Rules, which may begin in 2024 in several jurisdictions where Intel operates. In contrast, Microsoft acknowledges the global minimum tax as part of its broader regulatory exposure but does not expect a material increase in tax costs due to limited operations in jurisdictions below the 15% minimum rate. This suggests that while both companies are subject to Pillar Two, their exposure differs based on geographic tax strategy and operational footprint.",

        "Hop 1: INTC \u2192 Pillar Two Model Rules: Intel is actively assessing the impact of Pillar Two Model Rules in non-US jurisdictions where it operates, which could affect its tax benefits from non-US income.",

      "answer": "Oracle identifies the OECD's 15% global minimum tax as a potential material risk, noting that changes under Pillar Two could increase taxes on its international profits due to its multinational operations and exposure to various tax jurisdictions. In contrast, Intel reports that it does not expect the Pillar Two rules to materially increase its global tax costs because a higher proportion of its income is taxed in non-US jurisdictions, which already align with or exceed the minimum rate. The Boeing document clarifies that Pillar Two applies globally and is being enacted in many jurisdictions, but since Intel operates in locations with tax rates above the 15% threshold, it anticipates minimal impact, whereas Oracle, with a potentially more tax-efficient international structure, faces greater risk of tax increases under the same framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ORCL \u2192 Global Minimum Tax: Oracle explicitly states that the OECD's global minimum tax could materially increase its international tax burden, highlighting its exposure through multinational operations.",

        "Hop 3: Pillar Two Model Rules \u2190 INTC: Intel states that it does not expect Pillar Two to materially increase its tax costs because its income is taxed in non-US jurisdictions at rates above the 15% minimum, unlike Oracle."

      "question": "How do Cisco's strategic investments in cloud security offerings compare to Broadcom's approach to valuing developed technology in the same domain, particularly regarding their financial and operational implications?",
      "answer": "Cisco emphasizes strategic investments in cloud-based security offerings as part of its broader End-to-End Security portfolio, integrating AI-driven threat detection and cloud-native services like Cisco+ Secure Connect to enhance secure access. Broadcom, on the other hand, values its developed technology in cloud security using the multiperiod excess earnings method under the income approach, which focuses on the present value of projected cash flows while accounting for contributions from other assets. While Cisco\u2019s approach centers on expanding capabilities and integration to meet customer demand for cloud security, Broadcom\u2019s strategy involves financial modeling to assess the long-term economic value and lifecycle of developed technologies in the same space.",

These export restrictions are part of broader export control regulations that also affect AMD. In response, AMD is complying with U.S. laws, including those related to the Entity List designation, which specifically restricts its activities with Chinese entities like the THATIC JV. AMD\u2019s compliance strategy includes halting certain technology transfers and managing licensing arrangements, such as the $12 million in royalty income recognized in 2021 from its prior IP licensing agreement with THATIC JV, while ensuring adherence to U.S. export control laws.",

Risk factors\n\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n## Risks related to our business and industry\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain.\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.\n\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 25% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

      "question": "How does AMD's reliance on Microsoft's operating system development for x86 innovation compare with QCOM's in-house OS development strategy, particularly in terms of their respective impacts on gross margins and competitive differentiation in the semiconductor market?",
      "answer": "AMD depends heavily on Microsoft to design operating systems that support its x86-based microprocessor and graphics products, which is critical for maintaining software compatibility and enabling innovation beyond Intel's x86 instruction set. This dependency introduces risk, as failure to retain Microsoft's support could reduce independent software vendors' willingness to optimize for AMD, potentially harming product adoption and pricing power. In contrast, QCOM develops its own operating systems and system software as part of its broader semiconductor and IP licensing business (QCT segment), which gives it greater control over its software ecosystem and allows for tighter integration with its hardware. This in-house capability likely enhances QCOM's ability to differentiate its offerings in mobile, automotive, and IoT markets, potentially improving gross margins through proprietary value-add. While AMD's reliance on Microsoft introduces a dependency that could compress margins under unfavorable software certification or support scenarios, QCOM's vertically integrated model may insulate it from such third-party risks and support higher-margin product strategies.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs.

With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

      "question": "How do supply chain differences between INTC's long-term purchase commitments and AMD's GF wafer supply agreement affect their exposure to third-party manufacturing delays for 7nm+ products?",
      "answer": "INTC's long-term purchase commitments and prepayments with third-party suppliers, particularly for substrates and foundry capacity, increase its exposure to inventory and financial risks if customer demand falls below expectations or if delivery schedules are delayed. These commitments may leave INTC with excess or obsolete inventory and underutilized prepayments, especially if third-party manufacturers fail to deliver on schedule. In contrast, AMD has a structured wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries (GF) through 2025 that includes minimum annual capacity allocations and fixed pricing. However, if GF fails to meet its capacity obligations or if AMD's actual wafer requirements fall short of purchase targets, AMD could face significant delays or excess inventory costs. Both companies are exposed to third-party manufacturing delays, but AMD's contractual structure with GF offers more defined capacity guarantees, while INTC's broader supplier commitments expose it to more variable risks across its supply chain, particularly for 7nm and smaller node products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC \u2192 Delivery Schedules: INTC has long-term purchase commitments and prepayments with third-party suppliers, especially for substrates and foundry capacity, which increase financial and inventory risks if delivery schedules are disrupted or demand falls short.",
        "Hop 2: Delivery Schedules \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: Delays or failures in delivery schedules directly impact the ability of third-party manufacturers to meet production targets, affecting both inventory levels and customer delivery timelines.",
        "Hop 3: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2190 AMD: AMD has a defined wafer supply agreement with GF through 2025 that includes minimum annual capacity allocation and fixed pricing, but failure by GF to meet these obligations could result in significant shipment delays, while AMD also faces risks if actual wafer purchases fall short of targets."

      "answer": "IBM is exposed to data localization requirements due to its global operations, with Saudi Arabia being one of the jurisdictions enforcing such rules, which could impact its data management and compliance costs. NVDA, on the other hand, is subject to U.S. export controls that now require licenses for shipments of high-performance chips like the H100 and A100 to Saudi Arabia under the October 2023 rules. This creates a dual challenge: IBM must adapt to local data storage mandates in Saudi Arabia, while NVDA faces potential delays or denials in exporting key AI chips to the same region, affecting both companies' market access and revenue potential in the country.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

We  take  measures  to  prevent  transacEons  that  do  not  comply  with  OFAC  and  other  applicable s a ncEons,  including  establishing  a  risk-based  compliance  program  that  has  policies,  procedures  and  controls  designed  to  prevent  us  from  having  unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or enEEes.  As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their l oca l  s a ncEons  obliga Eons  a nd U.S. a nd EU s a ncEons  progra ms.  In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List). Iran and  Syria have been idenEfied by the  U.S.  State  Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated enEEes located in these countries and do not license enEEes domiciled there.

We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nPrivacy, Data ProtecHon, AI and InformaHon Security. Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

Wi th  res pect  to i nformaEon  security,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S.  SecuriEes  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  'SEC')  disclosure  rules  that  require,  among  other  things,  disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and M acau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A 100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A 100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NV IDIA  integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A 100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the M iddle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi A rabia, the United A rab Emirates, and V ietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A 100, A 800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX  4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\n\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A 800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to 'Tier 2' status. The A I Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select 'Universal V erified End Users', or UV EU, and lesser benefits on 'National V erified End Users', or NV EU. The A I Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers  of  cov ered  products  to  Tier  2  countries  and  companies  in  Tier  1  countries  that  are  either  headquartered  in  Tier  2,  or  hav e  an  ultimate  parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers' costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR's licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA reported that its fiscal 2022 effective tax rate was significantly reduced due to income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, including Hong Kong, which contributed to a 1.9% effective tax rate. Specifically, NVIDIA\u2019s tax disclosures indicate that income from Hong Kong was a material factor in lowering its global tax burden. Meanwhile, Apple generated $31,153 million in operating income from its Greater China segment in fiscal 2022. While the exact dollar value of NVIDIA\u2019s tax benefit from Hong Kong alone is not quantified, the comparison suggests that for NVIDIA, the region's low tax regime had a substantial impact on its global effective tax rate, whereas for Apple, Greater China represented a significant profit center in absolute dollar terms.",

Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\n\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense  was  $236  million  and  $184  million  in  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  The  increase  in  expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\n\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in nonaffiliated  entities.  Refer  to  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe increase in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  year  2022  as  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  was  primarily  due  to  an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 was 1.9%, significantly lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, due in part to income earned in jurisdictions like Hong Kong that have lower tax rates. Meanwhile, Apple reported $31,153 million in operating income from $74,200 million in net sales in the Greater China region during fiscal year 2022, resulting in an operating income margin of approximately 42%. These metrics reflect different financial impacts from operating in the region, with NVIDIA benefiting from lower tax rates and Apple demonstrating strong profitability from its sales in the same market.",

Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\n\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense  was  $236  million  and  $184  million  in  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  The  increase  in  expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\n\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in nonaffiliated  entities.  Refer  to  Note  9  of  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  Part  IV,  Item  15  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe increase in  our  effective  tax  rate  in  fiscal  year  2022  as  compared  to  fiscal  year  2021  was  primarily  due  to  an increase in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

AVGO\u2019s disclosures explicitly differentiate Level 1 and Level 2 securities based on valuation methodology, suggesting that ACN\u2019s choice to classify these assets as Level 2 could reduce transparency and comparability in investment valuation practices between the two firms.",

      "answer": "Oracle notes that changes to immigration laws have made it more difficult to recruit or relocate highly skilled personnel, particularly in countries where technical expertise is available at lower costs. Additionally, Oracle has been adjusting its workforce globally, which includes hiring in lower-cost regions, but faces increased competition and potential expenses from workforce reductions. Meanwhile, Broadcom states that current or future immigration laws may make it harder to hire or retain qualified engineers, especially in high-demand regions like Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia. Broadcom has also significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards under its 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, which could impair its ability to attract and retain talent. Therefore, while both companies are negatively impacted by immigration laws, Oracle emphasizes global workforce adjustments and flexible work policies, whereas Broadcom highlights equity compensation constraints and regional talent scarcity.",

These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees. We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. We recently reopened certain of our offices around the globe and we intend to reopen other offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow. Our employees continue to have flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all of the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it  may  fail  to  yield  these  desired  benefits  and  could  also  lead  to  increased  employee  burnout  or  negatively  impact  employee productivity, and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy. Despite our efforts to reopen our offices in a safe manner, our employees who have opted to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose us to potential liability.\n\nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.\n\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise  are  available  at  lower  costs.  When  we  make  adjustments  to  our  workforce,  we  may  incur  expenses  associated  with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\n\nOur  general  compensation  program  includes  restricted  stock  units  and  performance-based  equity,  which  are  important  tools  in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\n\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results. Our cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if:\n\n- our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;\n- any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant;\n- the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or",

Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, DE&amp;I, sustainability and social impact, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives. Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging, our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') practices, including as they relate to sustainability, DE&amp;I, or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, environmental impact (including deforestation, packaging, plastic, energy and water use and waste management), our ESG practices or our sustainability targets. In addition, the proliferation of digital and social media has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination and the potential for negative publicity. Negative publicity, posts or comments on digital and social media about us, our brands, our products, our sustainability efforts, our environmental and social impact (including our packaging) or our employees, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.\n\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, compliance and ESG practices, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\n\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\n\n## Our success depends upon our ability to recruit, attract and retain key employees, including through the implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and the succession of senior management.\n\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to recruit, attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. Further, changes in immigration laws and government policies, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have made, in certain circumstances, and may continue to make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. Our ability to attract and retain talent has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the United States, which is experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, a shift toward remote work and the effects of COVID-19. In addition, we also continue to work to advance culture change through the implementation of DE&amp;I initiatives throughout our organization. We are also implementing new ways of working to, among other things, instill a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization. If we do not (or are perceived not to) successfully implement these initiatives, our ability to recruit, attract and retain talent may be adversely impacted.",

In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees. However, the amendments to our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders in 2021 significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards. As a result, we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy, which could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## The failure to complete our acquisition of VMware, Inc. may adversely affect our business and our stock price.\n\nConsummation of the VMware Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions, (ii) the receipt by VMware of a tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of certain aspects of the VMware Merger, (iii) the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the VMware Merger, (iv) authorization for listing additional shares of Broadcom common stock on Nasdaq, and (v) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either us or VMware. There can be no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when expected, if at all. If the VMware Merger is not completed, our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition. Furthermore, if the VMware Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including incurring significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recover, negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Additionally, under certain specified circumstances, including the termination by either us or VMware because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained, upon termination we would be required to pay VMware a termination fee of $1.5 billion.\n\n## Failure to realize the benefits expected from the VMware Merger could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n\nAlthough we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize any of them, or realize them within the anticipated timeframe. Achieving these benefits will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully and efficiently. The challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following:\n\n- preserving customer and other important relationships of VMware and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n- integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n- consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures;\n- coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities;\n- coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated; and\n- integrating employees and related HR systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees.\n\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the VMware Merger on our anticipated timeframe or at all and our revenue, expenses, operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. The successful integration of the VMware business will require significant management attention both before and after the completion of the VMware Merger, and may divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues.\n\n## We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities.\n\nAny acquisitions we may undertake, including the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\n- unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business;\n- diversion of management's attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;",

      "answer": "AMD relies on Microsoft to design and develop its operating systems to work with AMD's x86-based microprocessor products, particularly for innovation beyond the Intel-controlled x86 instruction set. This dependency is explicitly stated in AMD's 2022 10-K filing, where it notes that if Microsoft does not continue to develop operating systems compatible with AMD's x86 instruction sets, independent software providers may avoid designing applications for AMD's innovations. In contrast, Oracle internally develops operating systems as part of its hardware business, which includes infrastructure technologies like Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage with operating systems and virtualization software. Oracle's approach avoids external dependencies by integrating OS development into its hardware offerings, recognizing hardware-related software revenues as part of its business model.",

      "answer": "Intel reported $6,867 million in net revenue from operations in Taiwan in 2023, indicating a direct financial exposure to the region. Meanwhile, Qualcomm explicitly states that its business depends on receiving consistent and reliable chipset supply from foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan. A significant or prolonged military or geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent Qualcomm from receiving this supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. While Intel's exposure is financial and regional, Qualcomm's dependency is operational and supply-chain focused, with both companies facing distinct but interconnected risks tied to the geopolitical stability of Taiwan.",

      "question": "How does the redemption of Nuance's convertible senior notes impact Microsoft's financial liabilities compared to AMD's experience with similar debt instruments, given Nuance's integration into Microsoft's cloud segment?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's redemption of $985 million out of $986 million of Nuance's convertible senior notes significantly reduced its exposure to these liabilities, leaving only $1 million outstanding as of June 30, 2022. This redemption aligns with Microsoft's integration of Nuance into its Intelligent Cloud segment, where the acquired goodwill supports the strategic value of the acquisition. Meanwhile, AMD also experienced a reduction in debt due to conversions of its 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, which contributed to a $13 million decrease in interest expense in 2021 compared to 2020. Both companies demonstrate a trend of managing convertible debt through conversions, but Microsoft's action was more definitive in nearly eliminating this liability class post-acquisition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.",

The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain  customers  or  by  requiring  third-party  financing,  loans  or  leases  to  support  credit  exposure.  These  credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  one  customer  that  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  trade  receivables,  which accounted  for  10%.  The  Company's  cellular  network  carriers  accounted  for  44%  and  42%  of  total  trade  receivables  as  of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\n\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers.

      "answer": "Salesforce (CRM) identifies the OECD's Pillar Two Model Rules, which introduce a global minimum tax of 15%, as a material global tax development that could impact multinational businesses. Intel (INTC), which reports that a higher proportion of its income is taxed in non-US jurisdictions, is actively evaluating the impact of Pillar Two, particularly as several non-US jurisdictions, including EU Member States, have enacted or plan to enact legislation aligning with the rules starting in 2024. Since Intel's effective tax rate has been influenced by its geographic income distribution and non-US tax regimes, the implementation of Pillar Two could constrain its ability to benefit from lower tax jurisdictions, thereby increasing its effective tax rate or reducing future tax benefits.",

      "answer": "Delays in software updates from third-party vendors, such as BIOS and drivers necessary for AMD's x86-based APU products to function optimally, could hinder product adoption and market readiness (from hop2_evidence). Concurrently, TSMC's challenges in achieving sufficient yields at the 7nm process node could lead to increased production costs and supply constraints (from hop3_evidence). Together, these factors could result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs and delayed product shipments, directly compressing AMD's gross margin and reducing its ability to meet customer demand for its APU products, especially if Intel continues to maintain tighter control over x86 instruction set compatibility (from hop1_evidence).",

        "Hop 1: INTC \u2192 Software Updates: Intel's historical control over x86 instruction sets and its influence on software compatibility affects how AMD\u2019s APU products are supported by third-party software vendors.",

          "chunk_text": "## European Commission Competition Matter\n\nIn 2001, the EC commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors. We received numerous requests for information and documents from the EC and we responded to each of those requests. The EC issued a Statement of Objections in July 2007 and held a hearing on that Statement in March 2008. The EC issued a Supplemental Statement of Objections in July 2008. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged \"conditional rebates and payments\" that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged \"payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.\" The EC imposed a fine in the amount of \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to \"immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in\" the EC decision.\n\nThe EC decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices. Instead, the decision stated that we should \"cease and desist\" from further conduct that, in the EC's opinion, would violate applicable law. We took steps, which are subject to the EC's ongoing review, to comply with that decision pending appeal. We had discussions with the EC to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices.\n\nWe appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. The hearing of our appeal took place in July 2012. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of Intel's grounds of appeal. The EC and interveners filed briefs in November 2014, we filed a reply in February 2015, and the EC filed a rejoinder in April 2015. The Court of Justice held oral argument in June 2016. In October 2016, Advocate General Wahl, an advisor to the Court of Justice, issued a non-binding advisory opinion that favored Intel on a number of grounds. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. The General Court appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC's 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice's clarifications of the law. In November 2017, the parties filed initial \"Observations\" about the Court of Justice's decision and the appeal and were invited by the General Court to offer supplemental comments to each other's \"Observations,\" which the parties submitted in March 2018. Responses to other questions posed by the General Court were filed in May and June 2018. The General Court heard oral argument in March 2020, and on January 26, 2022 issued a decision annulling the EC's finding against Intel regarding rebates as well as the fine on Intel. Any appeal of the General Court's decision must be brought before the Court of Justice by early April 2022.\n\n## Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified us and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities (now commonly referred to as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown\") that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 3, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel and, in certain cases, our current and former executives and directors, in US federal and state courts and in certain courts in other countries relating to the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, as well as other variants of these vulnerabilities that have since been identified.\n\nAs of January 25, 2022, consumer class action lawsuits relating to the above class of security vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 2018 were pending in the United States, Canada, and Israel. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, numerous individual class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated in April 2018 for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon. In March 2020, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the complaint in that consolidated action but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. In March 2021, the court granted Intel's motion to dismiss the amended complaint but granted plaintiffs leave to further amend in part. Plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint in May 2021, which Intel moved to dismiss in July 2021. In Canada, in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled. In a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec, a stay of the case was in effect until December 2021, and the parties' joint request for a further stay to May 2022 is pending with the court. In Israel, two consumer class action lawsuits were filed in the District Court of Haifa. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the first lawsuit in July 2021. Intel filed a motion to stay the second case pending resolution of the consolidated proceeding in the US, and a hearing on that motion has been scheduled for April 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n106",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.  In  most  instances,  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights  for  any  product  that  we  have  removed  from  our  price  book  that  is  less  than  12  months  older  than  the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.  Our  business  processes  and information  systems  need  to  be  sufficiently  scalable  to  support  the  growth  of  our  business  and  may  require modifications  or  upgrades  that  expose  us  to  a  number  of  operational  risks.  As  such,  our  information  systems  will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.",

Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

          "chunk_text": "company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/or OFDMAbased technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

      "question": "How does Microsoft's reliance on third-party manufacturers for Surface devices compare to Intel's exposure to delivery schedule risks from third-party foundries, given AMD's explicit challenges with TSMC's capacity constraints affecting GPU production timelines?",
      "answer": "Microsoft depends on third-party manufacturers for the majority of its Surface devices, with the ability to switch vendors in most cases, though some components have limited suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact Microsoft's ability to meet consumer demand. AMD's filings specifically highlight how TSMC's capacity constraints at 7 nm or smaller nodes have directly affected their GPU production timelines, with supply fluctuations potentially leading to lost sales. Intel, while not naming specific vendors, acknowledges significant exposure to delivery schedule risks from third-party foundries and component suppliers, noting that delays in manufacturing processes could prevent them from meeting customer demand. Unlike Microsoft's general risk description, Intel's exposure mirrors AMD's more directly, as both face risks tied to third-party foundry capacity and process development timelines.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "question": "How does AMD's reliance on third-party manufacturers for 7 nm and smaller node production impact its exposure to quality control risks compared to Cisco's approach of maintaining quality control through automated testing and ISO 9001-certified processes?",
      "answer": "AMD's reliance on third-party manufacturers like TSMC for 7 nm and smaller node production exposes it to risks related to manufacturing yields, delivery schedules, and quality assurance, as these manufacturers are responsible for implementing leading-edge process technologies and maintaining acceptable yields. In contrast, Cisco maintains quality control internally through automated testing equipment, burn-in procedures, and ISO 9001-certified manufacturing processes, which are designed to ensure product reliability and reduce variability. This difference suggests that AMD has less direct control over quality assurance in its supply chain compared to Cisco, which integrates quality control directly into its manufacturing procedures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: AMD depends on third-party manufacturers like TSMC to produce wafers at 7 nm or smaller nodes, and any failure to meet quality or yield standards could materially affect its business.",
        "Hop 2: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2192 Quality Control: AMD has limited control over quality assurance, yield, and cycle times from third-party manufacturers, increasing its exposure to supply disruptions and quality inconsistencies.",
        "Hop 3: Quality Control \u2190 CSCO: Cisco maintains quality control through ISO 9001-certified manufacturing processes, automated testing, and burn-in procedures, ensuring product reliability and consistency across customer-specific configurations."

The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain  customers  or  by  requiring  third-party  financing,  loans  or  leases  to  support  credit  exposure.  These  credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\n\nAs  of  September  24,  2022,  the  Company  had  one  customer  that  represented  10%  or  more  of  total  trade  receivables,  which accounted  for  10%.  The  Company's  cellular  network  carriers  accounted  for  44%  and  42%  of  total  trade  receivables  as  of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\n\n## Vendor Non-Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company.

      "question": "How do U.S. export control regulations affecting Qualcomm's (QCOM) operations compare to the export restrictions impacting Texas Instruments' (TXN) shipments to China, particularly in terms of how these regulatory constraints influence each company's exposure to the Chinese market, given that Qualcomm cites U.S. Export Administration Regulations as a key risk and Texas Instruments notes that export restrictions have caused Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm (QCOM) explicitly identifies U.S. Export Administration Regulations as part of its regulatory risk exposure, noting that compliance with such laws\u2014including those governing imports, exports, and national security\u2014is complex, evolving, and could significantly affect its business and financial results. These regulations directly constrain its ability to operate freely in certain jurisdictions, particularly China, where geopolitical tensions are exacerbated by U.S./China trade disputes. On the other side, Texas Instruments (TXN) reports that export restrictions have already caused Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers, directly impacting its revenue stream, as China accounts for approximately 25% of TXN\u2019s total revenue. The shared causal link through Export Control Regulations \u2192 Export Restrictions reveals that both companies face diminished market access in China, but Qualcomm emphasizes the risk of non-compliance and evolving regulation interpretation, whereas Texas Instruments highlights an active market shift by Chinese buyers away from U.S. suppliers due to these restrictions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 Export Control Regulations: Qualcomm identifies U.S. Export Administration Regulations as a major compliance risk, noting that evolving interpretations and geopolitical tensions\u2014especially with China\u2014could limit its ability to operate and negatively impact its financial results.",
        "Hop 2: Export Control Regulations \u2192 Export Restrictions: The evidence from AMD\u2019s filing shows that export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures can limit a semiconductor company\u2019s ability to export products to certain customers, establishing a regulatory mechanism that leads to export restrictions.",
        "Hop 3: Export Restrictions \u2190 TXN: Texas Instruments states that export restrictions have caused Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers, directly affecting its business given that China represents about 25% of its revenue."

          "chunk_text": "Our stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as: volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees, including any announcement concerning the initiation of, or any developments in, any lawsuit or governmental investigation or proceeding against us; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management's attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.'\n\n## Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.\n\nOur business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others, Regulations related to: patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; imports and exports, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; privacy and data protection; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure; automotive industry safety and quality standards; and business conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled ' Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,' ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,' 'A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,' ' There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,' and 'Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.'\n\nRegulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## There are risks associated with our debt.\n\nOur outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.\n\n## Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. Risk factors\n\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n## Risks related to our business and industry\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain.\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.\n\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 25% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's IoT product integration with generative AI capabilities compare to Qualcomm's enablement of generative AI in IoT edge devices, given Oracle's focus on cloud infrastructure and Qualcomm's leadership in mobile and edge computing technologies?",
      "answer": "Oracle integrates IoT with generative AI through its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which offers AI Infrastructure offerings and emerging technologies like IoT and generative AI as cloud services. Oracle's infrastructure technologies are designed to be flexible and scalable, supporting deployment in cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments, and represented 54% of its total cloud services and license support revenues in fiscal 2024. Qualcomm, on the other hand, enables generative AI in IoT edge devices through its Snapdragon platforms and wireless AI technologies, emphasizing on-device processing for improved latency, privacy, and personalization. Qualcomm projects that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, and it expects increased adoption of generative AI in IoT, XR, and automotive applications. Both companies are expanding into generative AI, but Oracle focuses on cloud-based integration while Qualcomm emphasizes edge computing and mobile platforms.",

      "question": "How does NVDA's dependency on foundries for advanced process node manufacturing at 7nm and smaller compare to AMD's reliance on larger wafers for competitive IC production, given both companies' exposure to TSMC's fabrication capabilities?",
      "answer": "NVDA depends on foundries like TSMC to manufacture its semiconductor wafers using advanced process node technologies such as 7nm and smaller, which are critical for producing high-performance GPUs and meeting customer demand. NVDA faces risks including supply shortages, yield issues, and delays if TSMC cannot scale production or implement new technologies effectively. Similarly, AMD relies on TSMC to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes, and specifically mentions the importance of transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes to maintain cost efficiency and product competitiveness. Both companies are exposed to risks if TSMC fails to deliver sufficient quantities of 7nm or smaller wafers, which could increase per-unit costs, delay product launches, and harm customer relationships. This shared dependency on TSMC for leading-edge wafer production highlights a critical supply chain vulnerability affecting both NVDA and AMD.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Foundries: NVDA depends on foundries, particularly TSMC, to manufacture its semiconductor wafers using advanced process node technologies such as 7nm and smaller, which are essential for its GPU product lines.",
        "Hop 2: Foundries \u2192 Larger Wafers: TSMC must transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes to maintain cost-effective production and competitive performance attributes for ICs, including those used by AMD.",
        "Hop 3: Larger Wafers \u2190 AMD: AMD relies on TSMC to produce wafers at 7nm and smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, and any failure to do so could materially impact its business and gross margins."

          "chunk_text": "company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/or OFDMAbased technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

      "answer": "The export restrictions under U.S. export control regulations, which AMD must comply with, directly affect its operations in China, particularly with its THATIC joint ventures, which were added to the Entity List in June 2019. AMD had previously earned $12 million in licensing revenue from the THATIC JV in 2021, but its ability to continue engaging with these entities is constrained by these export restrictions. Similarly, Texas Instruments (TXN) reports that shipments to China-based customers represent about 25% of its total revenue, and trade tensions involving export restrictions could disrupt its ability to serve these customers or lead them to seek alternate suppliers. Therefore, both companies face material risks from these export restrictions\u2014one through constrained operations with Chinese joint ventures, and the other through potential revenue loss due to reduced access to the Chinese market.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. Risk factors\n\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\n## Risks related to our business and industry\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain.\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\n## Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.\n\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 25% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's projection for AI-capable IoT device growth compare with Oracle's IoT infrastructure development in terms of supporting generative AI workloads at the edge versus in the cloud?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm projects that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024, emphasizing edge-based AI processing through on-device capabilities like their Snapdragon X Series platforms to improve latency, privacy, and personalization. This aligns with their view that generative AI will expand into IoT applications, particularly consumer electronics. In contrast, Oracle develops IoT infrastructure within its cloud offerings, including AI Infrastructure and generative AI services, designed to work with on-premise or hybrid environments. Oracle's infrastructure technologies, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database and Exadata Cloud@Customer, are positioned to support real-time IoT data processing and integration with cloud-based AI models, highlighting a cloud-first but flexible deployment model. The two companies thus approach IoT and generative AI from different architectural perspectives\u2014Qualcomm focusing on edge-based AI execution and Oracle on cloud-based AI orchestration.",

      "question": "Oracle's hardware revenue increased from $535 million in 2023 to $546 million in 2024. Given Cisco's credit loss reserves for loan receivables dropped from $103 million in 2022 to $53 million in 2023, how might this trend in lower financing risk for hardware sales contrast with Oracle's relatively modest hardware revenue growth, and what could this imply about market dynamics for enterprise hardware financing?",
      "answer": "Oracle's hardware revenue grew slightly from $535 million in 2023 to $546 million in 2024, reflecting a 2.1% increase. Meanwhile, Cisco's credit loss reserves for loan receivables\u2014financing tools often tied to hardware sales\u2014fell significantly from $103 million in 2022 to $53 million in 2023, indicating improved credit quality or reduced financing exposure. This drop could suggest stronger demand or more reliable financing terms in the hardware market, which might have positively influenced Oracle's sales. However, Oracle's modest growth contrasts with this improvement in financing risk, potentially signaling either market saturation, competitive pressures, or a strategic shift away from hardware toward other offerings like cloud services.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL \u2192 Hardware: Oracle's hardware revenue increased from $535 million in 2023 to $546 million in 2024, showing a small growth of $11 million.",
        "Hop 2: Hardware \u2192 Loan Receivables: Cisco's loan receivables are financing tools tied to the sale of hardware, as stated in the document, and are used to support customer purchases.",

These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nOptimized Application  Experiences  consists  of  our  full  stack  observability  and  cloud-native  platform  offerings.  These  products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Our perpetual software in this category are distinct performance  obligations  where  revenue  is  recognized  upfront  upon  transfer  of  control.  Term  software  licenses  are  multiple performance  obligations  where  the  term  license  is  recognized  upfront  upon  transfer  of  control  with  the  associated  software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nIn addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support  services  and  advanced  services.  Technical  support  services  represent  the  majority  of  these  offerings  which  are  distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.

      "answer": "Cisco's allowance for credit losses on loan receivables decreased from $103 million in 2022 to $53 million in 2023, indicating a reduced financial risk or a strategic shift in extending credit for financing arrangements. These loan receivables are directly tied to Cisco's sale of hardware, software, and services, including technical support and advanced services, as disclosed in their 10-K filing. This suggests that Cisco actively finances its technical support offerings through loan arrangements with customers. In contrast, Microsoft's 10-K does not disclose any loan-based financing mechanisms for its technical support services; instead, Microsoft focuses on offering technical support as part of its broader portfolio of cloud-based solutions, software, and services, without reliance on customer financing arrangements.",

      "answer": "A prolonged geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan could severely disrupt NVIDIA's supply chain execution due to its dependency on foundry partners in the region, particularly for advanced GPU manufacturing. This could lead to production delays, inventory shortages, and an inability to meet customer demand, which NVIDIA has previously warned could damage customer relationships and reduce revenue. Similarly, Apple relies heavily on manufacturing operations in Taiwan, as part of its broader supply chain concentrated in the region. A disruption in Taiwan would likely delay product manufacturing and delivery, increase costs, and potentially force Apple to restructure its supply chain, which it has noted could be expensive and time-consuming. Both companies would face significant operational and financial risks due to their shared exposure to Taiwan's geopolitical stability.",

      "answer": "AVGO reported $365 million in long-lived assets in Taiwan for fiscal 2024, indicating a significant operational presence in the region. Meanwhile, QCOM explicitly stated that its business depends on receiving consistent and reliable chipset supply from foundry partners in Taiwan, and a significant or prolonged geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent this supply, materially impacting QCOM\u2019s business. This highlights that both companies have substantial exposure to Taiwan, but while AVGO\u2019s exposure is reflected in its asset base, QCOM\u2019s risk is operational and supply chain-dependent, making them vulnerable to the same regional geopolitical tensions in different ways.",

      "question": "How does Apple's reliance on manufacturing operations in Taiwan for a majority of its product assembly impact its exposure to regional geopolitical risks compared to Microsoft's business operations in Greater China through its regional center in Singapore?",
      "answer": "Apple's reliance on manufacturing in Taiwan for a significant portion of its product assembly increases its exposure to regional geopolitical risks, particularly given that Taiwan is included in Apple's Greater China segment, which is subject to trade policies and disputes that could result in tariffs, sanctions, and other business restrictions. Microsoft operates in Greater China through its regional operations center in Singapore, which supports logistics and vendor management across the region. However, unlike Apple, Microsoft's operations are not heavily dependent on localized manufacturing, reducing its exposure to supply chain disruptions tied to geopolitical tensions. Apple's outsourced manufacturing in Asia, including Taiwan, makes it more vulnerable to interruptions from tariffs, export controls, and public health crises, while Microsoft's regional center in Singapore primarily supports administrative and logistics functions, which can be more easily adapted or relocated if necessary.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

      "question": "How has AMD's revenue from operations in Taiwan compared to Apple's revenue contribution from Taiwan (as part of Greater China) in 2022, and what does this suggest about their relative market presence in the region?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD reported $2,091 million in revenue from operations in Taiwan. Apple, on the other hand, reported $74,200 million in net sales from the Greater China region, which includes Taiwan, China mainland, and Hong Kong. Since Taiwan is only a subset of Apple's Greater China segment, and no specific breakdown is provided for Taiwan's contribution within that region, we cannot directly compare the absolute revenue from Taiwan between the two companies. However, AMD's $2,091 million in Taiwan revenue represents a significant portion of its regional operations, whereas Apple's revenue in the broader Greater China region dwarfs AMD's exposure. This suggests that while Taiwan is a meaningful market for AMD, Apple's market presence and revenue scale in the broader Greater China region, including Taiwan, is substantially larger.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA is subject to U.S. export controls that restrict shipments of high-performance chips like the H100 and A100 to Saudi Arabia, a Country Group D5 jurisdiction, under updated licensing requirements effective from October 2023.

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and M acau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A 100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A 100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NV IDIA  integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A 100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the M iddle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi A rabia, the United A rab Emirates, and V ietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A 100, A 800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX  4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\n\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A 800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to 'Tier 2' status. The A I Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select 'Universal V erified End Users', or UV EU, and lesser benefits on 'National V erified End Users', or NV EU. The A I Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers  of  cov ered  products  to  Tier  2  countries  and  companies  in  Tier  1  countries  that  are  either  headquartered  in  Tier  2,  or  hav e  an  ultimate  parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers' costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR's licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.",

Some governments have  taken  acEon  to  provide  resources,  preferenEal  treatment  or  other  protecEon  to  selected domesEc payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own naEonal providers.  For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely in that country or by only domesEc companies.  Some jurisdicEons are currently considering adopEng or have adopted data l oca l i za Eon requirements, which mandate the collecEon, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders.  This is the case, for instance, in India, China  and  Saudi  Arabia.

We are subject to anE-money laundering ('AML') and countering the financing of terrorism ('CFT') laws and regulaEons globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic s a ncEons  programs,  including  those  imposed  and  administered  by  the  U.S.  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  European  Union.  We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

We  take  measures  to  prevent  transacEons  that  do  not  comply  with  OFAC  and  other  applicable s a ncEons,  including  establishing  a  risk-based  compliance  program  that  has  policies,  procedures  and  controls  designed  to  prevent  us  from  having  unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or enEEes.  As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their l oca l  s a ncEons  obliga Eons  a nd U.S. a nd EU s a ncEons  progra ms.  In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List). Iran and  Syria have been idenEfied by the  U.S.  State  Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated enEEes located in these countries and do not license enEEes domiciled there. We are also subject to anE-corrupEon l a ws   a nd  re gul a Eons   gl oba l l y,  i ncl udi ng  the   U.S.  Fore i gn  Corrupt  Pra cEce s   Act  a nd  the   U.K.  Bri be ry  Act,  whi ch,  a mong  othe r  thi ngs ,  ge ne ra l l y  prohi bi t  gi vi ng  or offering  payments  or  anything  of  value  for  the  purpose  of  improperly  influencing  a  business  decision  or  to  gain  an  unfair  business  advantage.

AddiEonally, regulaEons such as the EU's Payment Services DirecEve in the EEA require financial insEtuEons to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transacEons away from Mastercard products and provide payment iniEaEon and account informaEon services directly to consumers who use our products.  AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nPrivacy, Data ProtecHon, AI and InformaHon Security. Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

Wi th  res pect  to i nformaEon  security,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S.  SecuriEes  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  'SEC')  disclosure  rules  that  require,  among  other  things,  disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and inv estment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and serv ices to, or making inv estments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for gov ernment rev iew of transactions inv olv ing information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adv ersaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the av ailability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly ev olv ing sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned indiv iduals and countries, and (2) negativ e impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of rev enue, increased costs, loss of export priv ileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based serv ices internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolv e. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Priv acy Framework ('DPF') has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities hav e and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based serv ices that inv olv e the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of deliv ering our products and serv ices. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which applies to all of our activ ities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and serv ices offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been dev eloping new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Serv ices Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and serv ices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws inv olv e substantial expense and the div ersion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractiv e. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, priv ate lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR hav e recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies, and European data protection authorities hav e taken action to block or remov e serv ices from their markets. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. hav e adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n\nOur inv estment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the v alue of the serv ices we deliv er to customers, including AI serv ices, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory dev elopments that impede realizing the expected return from this inv estment. Ongoing legal analyses, rev iews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relev ant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sov ereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, mov ement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in serv ices, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower rev enue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innov ate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activ ity, negativ e publicity, and div ersion of management time and effort.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's Rule 10b5-1(c) arrangement for Director John Dabiri outlines a formulaic dollar-based sale of approximately 553 shares through December 2, 2024, based on the January 26, 2024 stock price. This structured approach provides investors with a clear, pre-defined framework for anticipating the timing and volume of insider sales. Similarly, Broadcom's Diane Bryant established a Rule 10b5-1(c) Trading Plan in September 2024 to sell up to 15,000 shares contingent on market price thresholds, with expiration on September 12, 2025. Both plans enhance investor visibility by formalizing sale parameters in advance, though Broadcom's volume-based approach with price triggers offers more flexibility compared to NVIDIA's fixed-amount formula. The use of Rule 10b5-1(c) by both companies demonstrates a commitment to regulatory compliance while improving market predictability around insider transactions.",

      "answer": "Oracle adopted ASU 2020-04 in Q1 fiscal 2024, which provided optional expedients for contract modifications affected by reference rate reform, such as replacing LIBOR, and had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-04 allowed Oracle relief in handling such modifications through December 31, 2024. Adobe, in contrast, actively uses hedging relationships to offset foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including $2.83 billion in foreign exchange contracts and Treasury lock agreements to fix interest rates on future debt issuance. While Oracle benefited from simplified compliance under ASU 2020-04, Adobe proactively manages risk through formal hedging instruments documented under GAAP.",

The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, with certain exceptions.

Contract modifications to replace reference rates affected by the reform occurred during 2021, 2022 and 2023.

If geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan disrupt operations, NVIDIA may not be able to secure sufficient supply to fulfill orders on time, which could damage customer relationships and lead to revenue loss. Similarly, Qualcomm explicitly states that its business depends on receiving consistent chipset supply from foundry partners in Taiwan, and a significant or prolonged conflict involving Taiwan could severely limit or prevent this supply, materially impacting its business. Both companies are exposed to the same regional risk due to their reliance on Taiwanese manufacturing infrastructure, amplifying the cross-company impact of geopolitical instability in the region.",

      "question": "How do product defects at QCOM and manufacturing yield challenges at third-party foundries differently impact the gross margin risks for QCOM versus INTC, given INTC's increased reliance on third-party foundries for advanced process nodes like Intel 4?",
      "answer": "Product defects at QCOM pose demand-side risks due to potential declines in customer demand for their 5G-based products and could result in inventory write-offs or reputational harm, directly affecting revenues. Meanwhile, manufacturing yield challenges at third-party foundries\u2014specifically impacting INTC's production of modular tiles on advanced foundry process technologies like Intel 4\u2014create supply-side constraints. These yield issues increase per-unit costs and reduce gross margins, particularly if INTC cannot secure sufficient capacity from third-party foundries. Unlike QCOM, which faces downstream demand volatility from defects, INTC's exposure is upstream, tied to supply chain bottlenecks and prepayment risks for substrate and foundry capacity. Both companies are exposed to product defects and manufacturing inefficiencies, but the financial impact manifests differently: QCOM through reduced revenue and customer demand, and INTC through increased production costs and margin compression.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 Errors: QCOM identifies product defects or errors as a risk that could lead to declining demand for their 5G-based products, impacting revenue and potentially triggering inventory write-offs or reputational damage.",
        "Hop 2: Errors \u2192 Third-Party Foundries: Manufacturing inefficiencies or errors at third-party foundries\u2014such as those used by both AMD and INTC\u2014can lead to yield issues, increasing per-unit costs and delaying product delivery, which directly affects gross margins.",
        "Hop 3: Third-Party Foundries \u2190 INTC: INTC's IDM 2.0 strategy increases reliance on third-party foundries for advanced nodes like Intel 4, exposing them to yield issues, capacity constraints, and prepayment risks, which could compress gross margins if yields are low or supply is delayed."

          "chunk_text": "## If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number  of  suppliers  and  our  operations  depend  upon  obtaining  deliveries  of  adequate  supplies  of  equipment  and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU  products.  Similarly,  certain  non-proprietary  materials  or  components  such  as  memory,  printed  circuit  boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If  the  delivery  of  such  supply  is  delayed  or  does  not  occur  for  any  reason,  it  could  materially  impact  our  ability  to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand  could  result  in  excess  inventory  and  an  increase  in  our  production  costs,  particularly  since  we  have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty  manufacturing  suppliers  purchase  are  complex,  it  is  sometimes  difficult  to  substitute  one  supplier  for  another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors.  Also,  some  of  these  materials  and  components  may  be  subject  to  rapid  changes  in  price  and  availability. Interruption  of  supply  or  increased  demand  in  the  industry  could  cause  shortages  and  price  increases  in  various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing  suppliers  are  unable  to  procure  materials  for  manufacturing  our  products,  our  business  would  be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Failure  to  achieve  expected  manufacturing  yields  for  our  products  could  negatively  impact  our  financial results.\n\nSemiconductor  manufacturing  yields  are  a  result  of  both  product  design  and  process  technology,  which  is  typically proprietary  to  the  manufacturer,  and  low  yields  can  result  from  design  failures,  process  technology  failures  or  a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during  production,  we  may  fail  to  achieve  acceptable  yields  or  experience  product  delivery  delays.  We  cannot  be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies  needed  to  manufacture  future  generations  of  our  products  profitably  or  on  a  timely  basis  or  that  our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are  implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay  in  the  technology  transitions  to  smaller  process  technologies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC's processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAny decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.",

          "chunk_text": "- increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.\n\nThese and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, and damage our customer relationships. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business, competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain their demand for our products. During 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available foundry manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that such shortages will continue in 2022. These shortages have limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, such as for our PSG products, and have adversely affected customer demand for our products, including in our CCG and DCG businesses, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these ongoing shortages.\n\nTo obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have increasingly entered into arrangements with some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements could still prove inadequate to meet our requirements, or our suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of these arrangements falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some cases may not be fully recoverable.\n\nWe utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of thirdparty foundries for manufacturing, which will include modular tiles manufactured on advanced foundry process technologies for use in our core computing offerings. Delays in the development of foundries' future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties.\n\nWhere possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location. For example, ASML is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we will be deploying in our Intel 4 and other future manufacturing process nodes. These tools are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes, and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers. Sole- or limited-source suppliers can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us and intensify the other risks described in this risk factor.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risks. Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nWe are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues. From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.\n\nCosts from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:\n\n- writing off some or all of the value of inventory;\n- recalling products that have been shipped;\n- providing product replacements or modifications;\n- providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;\n- defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages; and\n- paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies.",

This risk is compounded by the fact that new product introductions may reduce demand for existing products. Meanwhile, Accenture has made significant investments in AI technologies and services, including generative AI, and faces exposure if these technologies fail to gain market adoption or face regulatory challenges, such as those related to data privacy, bias, or intellectual property.

Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity . We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross M argin discussion below in this M anagement's Discussion and A nalysis for further discussion.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality  to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Revenue Allowances\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\n\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or M DFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.",

The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by M icron, a supplier of ours. A s another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an A ction Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the A ction Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability  of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\nFinally , our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in T aiwan and South Korea. A ny new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from T aiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\n## Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\nCertain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and government regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. A dditionally , our corporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various corporate sustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or ex pose us to liability .\n\n## Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability.\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as A I, in our products and services may result in reputational or financial harm and liability  and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building A I capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone A I applications. A I poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society , such as A I solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity , or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy , employment or other social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability . Lev eraging A I capabilities to potentially  improv e our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to A I may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for General Purpose A rtificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy A I processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in A I-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of A I by  us or others could undermine public confidence in A I and slow adoption of A I in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\n\n## Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify . A n unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctiv e relief.

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

      "answer": "Microsoft faces increased compliance costs and operational complexity due to evolving data localization laws, including those in Saudi Arabia, which restrict the cross-border movement of data and require localized handling. Saudi Arabia is specifically mentioned as one of the jurisdictions adopting such requirements, affecting Microsoft's ability to deliver cloud services efficiently and cost-effectively. Meanwhile, NVIDIA is subject to U.S. export licensing requirements for high-performance AI chips like the A100, H100, and L40S when exporting to Saudi Arabia (as part of Country Group D5). These restrictions have led to delays and compliance hurdles, limiting NVIDIA's market access and increasing administrative burdens. The combined effect of Saudi Arabia's localization policies creates a dual challenge: Microsoft must adapt its data architecture to comply with local laws, while NVIDIA must navigate export controls that further constrain its ability to supply critical AI infrastructure to the same region.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and inv estment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and serv ices to, or making inv estments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for gov ernment rev iew of transactions inv olv ing information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adv ersaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the av ailability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly ev olv ing sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned indiv iduals and countries, and (2) negativ e impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of rev enue, increased costs, loss of export priv ileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based serv ices internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolv e. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Priv acy Framework ('DPF') has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities hav e and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based serv ices that inv olv e the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of deliv ering our products and serv ices. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), which applies to all of our activ ities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and serv ices offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been dev eloping new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Serv ices Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and serv ices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws inv olv e substantial expense and the div ersion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractiv e. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, priv ate lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR hav e recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies, and European data protection authorities hav e taken action to block or remov e serv ices from their markets. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. hav e adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.\n\nOur inv estment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the v alue of the serv ices we deliv er to customers, including AI serv ices, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory dev elopments that impede realizing the expected return from this inv estment. Ongoing legal analyses, rev iews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relev ant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sov ereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, mov ement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in serv ices, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower rev enue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innov ate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activ ity, negativ e publicity, and div ersion of management time and effort.",

Some governments have  taken  acEon  to  provide  resources,  preferenEal  treatment  or  other  protecEon  to  selected domesEc payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own naEonal providers.  For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domesEc payments either enErely in that country or by only domesEc companies.  Some jurisdicEons are currently considering adopEng or have adopted data l oca l i za Eon requirements, which mandate the collecEon, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders.  This is the case, for instance, in India, China  and  Saudi  Arabia.

We are subject to anE-money laundering ('AML') and countering the financing of terrorism ('CFT') laws and regulaEons globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic s a ncEons  programs,  including  those  imposed  and  administered  by  the  U.S.  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  European  Union.  We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

We  take  measures  to  prevent  transacEons  that  do  not  comply  with  OFAC  and  other  applicable s a ncEons,  including  establishing  a  risk-based  compliance  program  that  has  policies,  procedures  and  controls  designed  to  prevent  us  from  having  unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or enEEes.  As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their l oca l  s a ncEons  obliga Eons  a nd U.S. a nd EU s a ncEons  progra ms.  In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List). Iran and  Syria have been idenEfied by the  U.S.  State  Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated enEEes located in these countries and do not license enEEes domiciled there. We are also subject to anE-corrupEon l a ws   a nd  re gul a Eons   gl oba l l y,  i ncl udi ng  the   U.S.  Fore i gn  Corrupt  Pra cEce s   Act  a nd  the   U.K.  Bri be ry  Act,  whi ch,  a mong  othe r  thi ngs ,  ge ne ra l l y  prohi bi t  gi vi ng  or offering  payments  or  anything  of  value  for  the  purpose  of  improperly  influencing  a  business  decision  or  to  gain  an  unfair  business  advantage.

AddiEonally, regulaEons such as the EU's Payment Services DirecEve in the EEA require financial insEtuEons to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transacEons away from Mastercard products and provide payment iniEaEon and account informaEon services directly to consumers who use our products.  AuthoriEes in the EU are also revising standards relaEng to the authenEcaEon of transacEons, which may increase the number of transacEons that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulaHon of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.

We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nPrivacy, Data ProtecHon, AI and InformaHon Security. Aspects of our operaEons or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and i nformaEon security laws and regulaEons in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respecEvely s ubject to, a mong other laws and regulaEons, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency informaEon safeguarding requirements under the GrammLeach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a wriNen, comprehensive informaEon security program and, increasingly, a number of  s ta te   da ta   a nd  pri va cy  l a ws .

Wi th  res pect  to i nformaEon  security,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S.  SecuriEes  and  Exchange  Commission  (the  'SEC')  disclosure  rules  that  require,  among  other  things,  disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are s ubject to the General Data ProtecEon RegulaEon (the 'GDPR') and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protecEon and informaEon security program to protect the personal and sensiEve data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use  the  GDPR  as  a  reference  to  adopt  new  or  updated  privacy,  data  protecEon  and  informaEon  security  laws  and  regulaEons,  although  divergences  have occurred. Laws and regulaEons in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collecEon and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensiEve data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulaEon in the EU as well as other places).

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and M acau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A 100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A 100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NV IDIA  integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A 100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the M iddle East.\n\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi A rabia, the United A rab Emirates, and V ietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A 100, A 800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX  4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\n\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A 100, A 800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. T o date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the 'AI Diffusion' IFR in the Federal Register. A fter a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose  a  worldwide  licensing  requirement  on  all  products  classified  under  Export  Control  Classification  Numbers,  or  ECCNs,  3A 090.a,  4A 090.a,  or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . A ny system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NV IDIA  DGX , HGX , and M GX  systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\n\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NV IDIA  products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A 090.a or 4A 090.a, including but not limited to: A 100, A 800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX  6000 A da.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to 'Tier 2' status. The A I Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on select 'Universal V erified End Users', or UV EU, and lesser benefits on 'National V erified End Users', or NV EU. The A I Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers  of  cov ered  products  to  Tier  2  countries  and  companies  in  Tier  1  countries  that  are  either  headquartered  in  Tier  2,  or  hav e  an  ultimate  parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers' costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\n\nThe AI Diffusion IFR's licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.",

      "answer": "AMD's ordering uncertainties, such as customer cancellations and indirect sales through distributors, have led to inventory write-downs of $X million in the Gaming and Client segments during Q3 2022, directly impacting gross margins. These challenges stem from difficulties in forecasting demand due to short product lifecycles and unpredictable customer behavior, especially in the PC and Embedded markets. Similarly, NVDA faces demand volatility from emerging AI trends, such as generative AI and cryptocurrency mining, which have created inconsistent demand patterns and supply mismatches. NVDA has had to increase prices due to supplier cost increases and has written down inventory in response to overestimation of demand. Both companies rely on estimates from downstream partners\u2014AMD from channel distributors and NVDA from OEMs, ODMs, and system integrators\u2014making their forecasting accuracy and gross margin stability highly sensitive to external market shifts and internal estimation errors.",

      "answer": "AMD's 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032 could be accelerated upon an Event of Default, which would require AMD to repay $1.0 billion in aggregate principal issued in 2022, plus accrued interest. Oracle, under its Revolving Credit Agreement, also faces potential acceleration if an Event of Default occurs, with the full $6.0 billion facility becoming due unless terminated earlier. Unlike AMD's notes, which are unsecured senior obligations, Oracle's Revolving Facility allows borrowing, prepayment, and reborrowing until March 8, 2027, with interest rates tied to credit ratings. Both companies face significant financial obligations upon default, but Oracle's structure allows more flexibility in managing short-term liquidity.",

        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032: AMD issued $1.0 billion in 2022 of these notes, which are unsecured senior obligations with semi-annual interest payments and potential acceleration upon an Event of Default.",
        "Hop 2: 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032 \u2192 Event of Default: An Event of Default could trigger the acceleration of AMD's 3.924% Senior Notes, requiring immediate repayment of the full principal plus accrued interest.",
        "Hop 3: Event of Default \u2190 ORCL: Oracle\u2019s $6.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement also includes clauses that allow for acceleration upon an Event of Default, with the full amount becoming due unless lenders terminate the agreement earlier."

      "question": "How does Broadcom's (AVGO) exposure to long-lived assets in Taiwan compare to Qualcomm's (QCOM) dependency on chipset supply from foundry partners in Taiwan, given the potential disruption from geopolitical tensions involving China and Taiwan?",
      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) reported $341 million in long-lived assets in Taiwan in fiscal year 2023, indicating a significant but measured operational presence in the region. Qualcomm (QCOM), on the other hand, relies heavily on foundry partners in Taiwan for consistent and reliable chipset supply, which is critical to its semiconductor manufacturing process. A significant or prolonged military or geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent Qualcomm from receiving chipset supply, which would have a material adverse impact on its business. While both companies are exposed to risks in Taiwan, Broadcom's exposure is more tied to asset value, whereas Qualcomm's is operational and directly linked to supply continuity from foundries in the region.",

However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.\n\nTo further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral provided for was $11 million and $40 million as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\n## (c) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\n\nWe hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward contracts.  These  currency  options  and  forward  contracts,  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  generally  have  maturities  of  less  than 24  months.  The  derivative instrument's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. G ains and losses on the contracts are  included  in  other  income  (loss),  net,  and  substantially  offset  foreign  ex change  gains  and  losses  from  the  remeasurement  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\n\nWe hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.\n\n## (d) Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe hold an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to a fixed-rate senior note that is due in fiscal 2025. Under the interest rate swap, we receive fix ed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on SOFR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate of the senior fix ed-rate note to a floating interest rate based on SOFR. The gain and loss related to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is included in interest ex pense and substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt attributable to the change in market interest rates.\n\n## (e) Equity Price Risk\n\nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.\n\nWe  are  also  ex posed  to  variability  in  compensation  charges  related  to  certain  deferred  compensation  obligations  to  employees  and  directors.  Although  not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense.",

Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for  other  costs  associated  with  network  installation  and  integration  of  our  products  and  services.  We  also  provide  financing  to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 15%.\n\nFinancing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and  typically  have  terms  of  up  to  three  years.  In  some  cases,  we  provide  guarantees  to  third  parties  for  these  lease  and  loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.\n\nThe  volume  of  channel  partner  financing  was  $27.9  billion,  $26.7  billion,  and  $26.9  billion  in  fiscal  2022,  2021,  and  2020, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and  $1.3  billion  as  of  July  30,  2022  and  July  31,  2021,  respectively.  We  could  be  called  upon  to  make  payments  under  these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance  with  revenue  recognition  policies,  or  we  record  a  liability  for  the  fair  value  of  the  guarantees.  In  either  case,  the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 30, 2022, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $179 million, of which approximately $9 million was recorded as deferred revenue.",

      "question": "How might AMD's interest coverage covenant requirements and cross-default provisions differently constrain its M&A flexibility compared to CRM's exposure to financing restrictions following an event of default?",
      "answer": "AMD's Revolving Credit Agreement requires maintaining a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and includes cross-default provisions that could accelerate debt repayment if other material indebtedness defaults. This creates a tighter constraint on AMD\u2019s financial flexibility, particularly if its operating performance weakens, as it could trigger covenant breaches and limit access to liquidity. In contrast, CRM\u2019s disclosures highlight that an event of default could impair its ability to secure future financing or result in higher borrowing costs, which poses a more prospective and conditional risk. While AMD faces more immediate operational constraints due to active covenants, CRM\u2019s limitations are more tied to future financing conditions, suggesting AMD\u2019s M&A flexibility is more directly constrained by its current credit structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD \u2192 Revolving Credit Agreement: AMD must maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and is subject to cross-default provisions that could accelerate debt repayment under its $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement.",
        "Hop 2: Revolving Credit Agreement \u2192 Events of Default: The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to meet covenants, which could trigger acceleration of the debt and significantly restrict AMD\u2019s access to capital.",
        "Hop 3: Events of Default \u2190 CRM: CRM notes that an event of default could impair its ability to obtain additional financing, renegotiate terms, or result in higher interest rates, which would constrain its future strategic options including M&A."

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's competitive positioning against Samsung in the SoC and GPU markets influence Intel's strategic challenges in scaling its IFS Foundry Services, particularly given Intel's historical manufacturing delays and competitive pressures?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA competes with Samsung in the SoC and GPU markets, which are critical to automotive, gaming, and accelerated computing applications. Samsung is also a key competitor to Intel's IFS Foundry Services, which Intel established as part of its IDM 2.0 strategy to become a major foundry provider. Intel highlights that IFS must compete with established players like Samsung on multiple fronts including time-to-market, process performance, and ecosystem support. However, Intel's history of manufacturing delays, such as the setbacks with its 10nm and Intel 4 (formerly 7nm) process technologies, creates a disadvantage compared to Samsung's mature foundry capabilities. These delays have already impacted Intel's product competitiveness and gross margins, and could hinder IFS's ability to attract customers in a market where timely access to advanced processes is critical. Therefore, NVIDIA's competitive pressure on Samsung indirectly affects Intel's ability to scale IFS, as Samsung remains a dual threat both in end-product markets and in the underlying manufacturing ecosystem.",

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' for a discussion of these potential impacts.",

For example, our DCG revenue and platform ASPs were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during 2021. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. For example, in 2020, NVIDIA announced an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings plc, and AMD announced an agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our financial results will be adversely affected, including reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.\n\nWe invest significantly in R&amp;D, and to the extent our R&amp;D efforts are unsuccessful, our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize a return on our investments. To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&amp;D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, and improve our existing products and processes, all ahead of competitors. We are focusing our R&amp;D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, and software. These include ambitious initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. We cannot guarantee that all of these efforts will deliver the benefits we anticipate. For example, we previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our Intel 4 process technology (formerly 7nm) would be delayed relative to our prior expectations. To the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance, performance per watt, and/or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yields and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we can face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages. In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. To the extent our R&amp;D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&amp;D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product.\n\nWe do not expect all of our R&amp;D investments to be successful. Some of our efforts to develop and market new products and technologies fail or fall short of our expectations, or are not well-received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies. We make significant investments in R&amp;D, and we expect our investments to grow as we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy. Our investments at times do not contribute to our future operating results for several years, if at all, and such contributions at times do not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments.\n\nOur investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed. We have entered new areas and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by ubiquitous computing, cloud to edge infrastructure, pervasive connectivity, and AI. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI accelerators, IPU products, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have announced plans to become a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, establishing IFS. IFS faces competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC and Samsung, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; manufacturing capacity; price; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Our \"big bets\" are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business, one of our prior big bets, based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.",

      "question": "How does AMD's dependency on Microsoft for x86 instruction set support contrast with Qualcomm's in-house development of operating systems, and what are the implications for each company's control over hardware-software integration in their semiconductor offerings?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm develops its own operating systems and system software as part of its broader semiconductor and technology licensing business (QCOM_10k_2022.pdf:page_7:chunk_1), giving it direct control over hardware-software integration for devices using its chipsets. In contrast, AMD relies on Microsoft Corporation to design and develop operating systems that support its x86-based microprocessor and graphics products (AMD_10k_2022.pdf:page_28:chunk_1). This dependency means AMD's ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set and ensure software compatibility is partially contingent on Microsoft's development roadmap and certification processes. Qualcomm's in-house approach reduces reliance on external vendors and allows for more tailored integration, while AMD must coordinate closely with Microsoft to ensure its hardware is supported in widely used operating systems, which could limit flexibility and responsiveness to market demands.",

          "chunk_text": "company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/or OFDMAbased technologies requires a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System), UWB (ultra-wideband) and Bluetooth . We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions, along with our licensing programs, have been integral to the growth and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nConnected Intelligent Edge. Advancements in processor technologies have allowed for new levels of on-device processing (also known as edge computing). Edge computing brings processing closer to where data is generated, helping to reduce response time, improve security and enable greater personalization. As 5G and other forms of wireless connectivity converge with highperformance, low-power processing and on-device intelligence, devices at the edge are able to share data with cloud-based applications and each other. This is enabling expanded functionality and use cases, which we believe will have significant impact across industries. It is leading to the creation of the connected intelligent edge, where we expect billions of smart devices to be deployed.\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has become the foundational technology to many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to quickly move to 5G technology. Beginning with the Release 15 specification issued by 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), an organization that develops technical specifications, 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, near-instantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and extended reality (XR), which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services while also reducing their operating costs.\n\nAlthough 5G networks are being deployed at a faster pace as compared to the transition from 3G to 4G networks, as with previous generations of mobile networks, it will take time. Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in April 2019, 226 operators in more than 90 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 500 operators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2022 (GSA, October 2022). Many 5G devices include multimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. This allows mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling operators to roll out 5G services over time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2022, there were approximately 7.5 billion 3G/4G/5G connections globally, representing 88% of total mobile connections (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022). By 2026, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.7 billion, with approximately 86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, October 2022).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. For calendar year 2022, we estimate that 3G, 4G, and 5G handset volumes will decrease by low-double digits year-over-year, with 5G smartphone shipments estimated between 600 and 650 million. Such expected decline in demand is primarily driven by the negative effects of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic measures in China.",

Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.

      "answer": "The implementation of the Pillar Two Model Rules could have differing impacts on Intel's and Oracle's effective tax rates. Intel noted in its 2023 10-K filing that it does not expect a material increase in global tax costs under Pillar Two, as it does not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates below the 15% global minimum. In contrast, Oracle explicitly acknowledged in its 2023 10-K that the adoption of Pillar Two in many jurisdictions may materially increase the level of income tax on its international profits, particularly due to its broader exposure in international markets where new taxing rights are being applied to digital technology businesses. This contrast suggests that while Intel's current geographic tax profile may insulate it from Pillar Two's effects, Oracle's international operations could face more pronounced tax cost increases under the new framework.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "answer": "Oracle uses interest rate swaps to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate debt at a rate of 3.07% plus margin, stabilizing its interest costs amid credit rating fluctuations. In contrast, Broadcom holds $56.3 billion in fixed-rate senior notes whose fair value fluctuates with market interest rates, with a 50-basis-point rate change impacting fair value by $1.7 billion. Cisco previously used an interest rate swap on $0.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes to convert to floating rates based on SOFR, indicating a strategy to manage interest rate exposure similar to Oracle\u2019s but in the opposite direction. This highlights differing risk management approaches: Oracle locks in fixed costs, while Broadcom faces valuation volatility but avoids floating rate expense variability.",

      "answer": "AMD's reliance on third-party manufacturers such as TSMC and GF for wafer fabrication at 7nm or smaller nodes and larger nodes respectively, and on ATMP joint ventures for packaging and testing, exposes AMD to supply chain risks including capacity constraints, delivery delays, and quality control issues. These risks are compounded by the fact that AMD does not have long-term contracts with all of its third-party manufacturers and must rely on subcontractors for critical components. Similarly, ACN's large-scale transformation projects depend on subcontractors and third-party vendors to deliver products and services on time and at anticipated costs. If subcontractor capacity is constrained due to upstream supply chain disruptions\u2014such as those affecting AMD\u2019s manufacturing partners\u2014ACN may face delays or cost overruns in delivering client projects, particularly if those projects involve semiconductor-dependent technologies or infrastructure. This shared dependency on subcontractors for mission-critical components creates an indirect but meaningful linkage between AMD\u2019s supply chain risks and ACN\u2019s project execution risks.",

However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Also, due to measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19, various patent offices and courts have been adversely impacted and there is a potential for delay or disruptions that might affect certain of our patent rights.\n\nFurthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others  may  independently  develop  similar  products,  duplicate  our  products  or  design  around  our  patents  and  other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.\n\nWe have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange  rates  could  cause  our  foreign  currency  denominated  expenses  to  increase  as  a  percentage  of  revenue, affecting  our  profitability  and  cash  flows.  Whenever  we  believe  appropriate,  we  hedge  a  portion  of  our  short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.\n\n## Operational and Technology Risks\n\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe  utilize  third-party  wafer  foundries  to  fabricate  the  silicon  wafers  for  all  of  our  products.  We  rely  on  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term  or  long-term  manufacturing  requirements.  If  we  experience  supply  constraints  from  our  third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result  in  lost  sales  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business.  For  example,  if  TSMC  is  not  able  to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.",

If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

          "chunk_text": "We are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business, all in a compressed timeframe. The scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic, social and political conditions. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations.\n\nThe overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex. The European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. Countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered. Individual countries across the globe and the European Union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), a global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The OECD proposals aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users, and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and, if enacted, the extent of their impact. The increased focus of the European Commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws (or in their interpretation or enforcement) around the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.",

      "answer": "VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), produced by Broadcom (AVGO), provides a unified platform that supports both virtual machines and containerized workloads, enabling advanced AI and machine learning at enterprise scale while offering license portability across on-premises and cloud environments. This capability enhances Broadcom\u2019s appeal to enterprises seeking hybrid cloud agility and data control. Oracle's OCI compute services also support virtual machines and are embedded with AI offerings designed for predictive use cases like machine part servicing and credit fraud detection. Oracle extends this with hybrid deployment models, including Exadata Cloud@Customer and OCI Dedicated Region, allowing customers to maintain data sovereignty and regulatory compliance. The integration of VCF\u2019s native Kubernetes and AI/ML support positions Broadcom to compete directly with Oracle\u2019s OCI by offering similar hybrid flexibility and AI scalability, making the two companies direct contenders in enterprise cloud infrastructure for AI-driven workloads.",

      "answer": "Broadcom (AVGO) faces cybersecurity risks from the maturation of AI capabilities, particularly around threats like deep fake impersonation and generative automation that could scale cyberattacks and expose the company to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational harm. These risks are compounded by their role as a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for government and infrastructure operators. Meanwhile, Salesforce (CRM) is directly impacted by AI-related regulatory developments, especially Europe's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which imposes mandatory risk management, incident reporting, and third-party outsourcing restrictions on financial sector firms. DORA's implementation increases Salesforce\u2019s compliance costs and could limit service adoption if they fail to meet stringent controls. The GS_10k_2024 evidence shows that evolving AI regulations are creating a complex compliance environment, where Broadcom\u2019s exposure centers on cybersecurity threats amplified by AI, while Salesforce faces operational and legal constraints tied to regulatory frameworks like DORA that govern how data and AI services are managed in the financial sector.",

The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that relies upon 'deep fake' impersonation technology or other forms of generative automation that may scale up the efficiency or effectiveness of cyber threat activity.\n\nAs a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both governmental entities and critical infrastructure operators, we and our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems supporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the l i kel i hood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure.\n\nAccidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers and business partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in our or their data or software have in the past exposed, and could in the future expose, us to a risk of information loss, business disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt our business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any regulatory non-compliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor's failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages.\n\nDespite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to disruptive cyber-attacks and unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks or those of our service providers or business partners. Although no such cybersecurity incidents have been material to us, we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future. Businesses we acquire have previously increased, and may continue to increase, the scope and complexity of our IT networks, and this has, from time to time, increased our risk exposure to cyber-attacks when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support operations for the acquired businesses.\n\nIn addition, certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and other trusted partners reliably safeguarding secrets (e.g., application credentials) and adhering to our security policies and access control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle such secrets or adhere to such policies and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in a material cyber incident. Our logging, alerting and cyber incident detection mechanisms may not cover every system potentially targeted by threat actors, may not have the capability to detect certain types of unauthorized activities, and may not capture and surface information sufficient to enable us to timely detect and take responsive action to insider or external threats.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as well as customers and service providers, have also increased their focus on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions concerning privacy, cybersecurity, secure technology development, data governance, data protection, confidentiality and IP could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties and may also increase our overall compliance burden. See also ' Failure of our software products to manage and security IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.'\n\nThe majority of our sales have historically come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe have historically depended on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract manufacturers ('CMs') and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For fiscal year 2024, sales to distributors accounted for 48% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to our top five end customers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2024. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by these customers.",

          "chunk_text": "## The  development  and  use  of  AI  present  risks  and  challenges  that may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe or our third-party vendors, clients or counterparties have in the past developed or incorporated, and may in the future develop or incorporate, AI  technology  in  certain  business  processes,  services  or  products.  The development  and  use  of AI  present  a  number  of  risks  and  challenges  to our  business.  The  legal  and  regulatory  environment  relating  to  AI  is uncertain  and  rapidly  evolving,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally,  and includes  regulation  targeted  specifically  at  AI  as  well  as  provisions  in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment and other laws  applicable  to  the  use  of  AI.  These  evolving  laws  and  regulations could require changes  in  our  implementation  of  AI  technology  and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information,  that  reflect  biases  included  in  the  data  on  which  they  are trained,  infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  others,  or  that  is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it  challenging  to  understand  why  they  are  generating  particular  outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring  the  capabilities  of  the AI  models,  reducing  erroneous  output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train  their  models,  including  risks  arising  from  the  inclusion  of  any unauthorized  material in the training data for their  models,  and  the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated  with  the  output  of  their  models,  matters  over  which  we  may have limited visibility. Additionally, we are exposed to risks related to the use  of  AI  technologies  by  third-party  vendors,  clients,  counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries. Any of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\n\nIn addition to our use of AI technologies, we are exposed to risks arising from  the  use  of  AI  technologies  by  bad  actors  to  commit  fraud  and misappropriate funds and to facilitate cyberattacks. Generative AI, if used to perpetrate fraud or launch cyberattacks, could result in losses, liquidity outflows  or  other  adverse  effects  at  a  particular  financial  institution  or exchange.\n\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients' information, against cyber attacks and similar  threats   could  impair  our  ability  to  conduct  our  bus ines s es , result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\n\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software  and  information  technology  service  providers,  governmental agencies  and  other  organizations  reporting  the  unauthorized  access  or disclosure  of  client,  customer  or  other  confidential  information  in  recent years,  as  well  as  cyber  attacks  involving  the  dissemination,  theft  and destruction  of  corporate  information  or  other  assets,  as  a  result  of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases where hackers have requested 'ransom' payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\n\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-ofservice attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to  protect  the  integrity  and  functionality  of  our  technology  infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of  cyber  attacks  as  we  expand  our  mobile-  and  other  internet-based products  and services, as well as our usage of mobile  and  cloud technologies,  and  as  we  provide  these  services  to  individual  consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients.  The  use  of  employee-owned  devices  presents  additional  risks  of cyber  attacks,  as  do  hybrid  work  arrangements.  In  addition,  due  to  our interconnectivity  with  third-party  vendors  (and  their  respective  service providers),  agent  banks,  exchanges,  clearinghouses  and  other  financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event.  These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the  third  party  subject  to  the  cyber  attack  or  other  information  security event  or  could  result  in  unauthorized  access  to  or  disclosure  of  client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective's claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court's judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers' data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.\n\n## Industry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.\n\nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may ex pect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results.\n\nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized 'in country,' as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow.\n\nFurther, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of AVGO's fixed rate senior notes to interest rate changes compare to CSCO's use of interest rate swaps in managing similar debt exposure, given the specific fair value impacts and hedging strategies outlined?",
      "answer": "AVGO's fixed rate senior notes are highly sensitive to interest rate changes, with a 50 basis point increase in rates causing a $1.7 billion decline in fair value as of November 3, 2024. In contrast, CSCO actively manages this risk using an interest rate swap with a $0.5 billion notional amount, which converts fixed interest payments on a portion of its senior notes to floating rates based on SOFR, thereby offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged debt. This indicates that while AVGO faces significant exposure due to the size of its unhedged fixed-rate debt ($56.3 billion), CSCO employs targeted hedging strategies to mitigate similar risks on its smaller fixed-rate debt base.",

        "Hop 1: AVGO \u2192 Fixed Rate Senior Notes: AVGO has $56.3 billion in fixed rate senior notes as of November 3, 2024, with a $1.7 billion fair value sensitivity to a 50 basis point interest rate change.",

The Bridge Credit Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, net cash proceeds received by us from certain debt and equity issuances shall result in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The proceeds of borrowings under the Bridge Facility were used to finance the acquisition of Cerner, our refinancing of indebtedness in connection with such acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. All amounts borrowed under the Bridge Credit Agreement will become due on March 7, 2023, unless settled earlier pursuant to the terms of the Bridge Credit Agreement. Interest is based on either (a) a Term SOFR-based formula plus a margin of 100.0 basis points to 137.5 basis points, depending on the credit rating assigned to our long-term senior unsecured debt, or (b) a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 0.0 basis point to 37.5 basis points, depending on the same such credit rating, each as set forth in the Bridge Credit Agreement.\n\nNo amounts were outstanding pursuant to either of the credit agreements as of May 31, 2022. On June 8, 2022, we drew down the full amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement to finance the acquisition of Cerner.\n\nEach of the abovementioned credit agreements contains certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including the requirement that the ratio of 'Consolidated EBITDA' to 'Consolidated Net Interest Expense' (each term as defined in the respective credit agreements) of Oracle and its subsidiaries shall not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter during the period that the credit agreement is effective. If an event of default occurs under one of the credit agreements and is not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the applicable credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments under that agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the two credit agreements' covenants as of May 31, 2022.\n\n## Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes\n\nOur existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private  placement  exemption  from  the  registration  requirements  under  federal  and  state  securities  laws  pursuant  to  dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. As of May 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes.\n\n## 8. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2022 Restructuring Plan). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, our management supplemented the 2022 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2022 Restructuring Plan are up to $392 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $223 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2022 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2022 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $169 million through the end of fiscal 2023. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.\n\n## Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our  operations  due  to  our  acquisitions  and  certain  other  operational  activities  (2019  Restructuring  Plan).

      "question": "How does the interest rate sensitivity of Cisco's $20.3 billion in senior fixed-rate notes impact the relative risk profile of Oracle's $401 million commercial paper program as of May 31, 2024, given that both instruments are subject to market interest rate fluctuations but serve different corporate financing strategies?",
      "answer": "Cisco's $20.3 billion in senior fixed-rate notes is subject to interest rate risk, where a 50 BPS increase or decrease in market rates would change the fair value of the debt by approximately $0.7 billion. This sensitivity highlights the exposure of long-term fixed-rate debt to market volatility. Oracle, in contrast, maintains a $6.0 billion commercial paper program, with $401 million outstanding as of May 31, 2024, which is used for short-term corporate purposes. While commercial paper is typically less sensitive to long-term interest rate shifts due to its short maturity, it still carries exposure to prevailing market rates at the time of issuance. Therefore, even though the two instruments differ in maturity and purpose, both are influenced by interest rate environments, affecting Cisco's long-term debt valuation and Oracle's short-term financing costs in distinct ways.",

      "answer": "The implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two Model Rules could have a differentiated impact on Intel and Salesforce. Intel, which reported a higher proportion of its income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions in 2023, may face increased tax costs if those jurisdictions adopt the 15% minimum tax rate, especially as it continues to evaluate the impacts of enacted and pending legislation in those regions. In contrast, Salesforce acknowledges exposure to global tax developments, including the Pillar Two rules, but with its growing international presence and brand prominence, it may face increased scrutiny and potential tax disputes in multiple jurisdictions. While Intel's current operations are not in jurisdictions with rates below the minimum, Salesforce's expanding global operations could lead to more complex tax liabilities under the new regime, affecting both companies' cash flows and financial results differently.",

      "answer": "Apple relies heavily on China Mainland for manufacturing, which is a key part of its Greater China segment that also includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. This reliance exposes Apple to risks such as trade tensions, tariffs, and supply chain disruptions. Microsoft operates in Greater China through its regional operations center in Singapore, which supports Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific. Microsoft also localizes many of its products to reflect local languages and conventions, modifying user interfaces and translating text to better serve the region. Both companies are significantly engaged in Greater China, but Apple's exposure is more supply-chain intensive while Microsoft's is more focused on localized customer engagement and regional support infrastructure.",

          "chunk_text": "The  Company  continues  to  monitor  the  situation  and  take  appropriate  actions  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  and requirements  of  relevant  authorities.  The  extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may  impact  the  Company's  operational  and financial  performance  remains  uncertain  and  will  depend  on  many  factors  outside  the  Company's  control,  including  the  timing, extent,  trajectory  and  duration  of  the  pandemic,  the  emergence  of  new  variants,  the  development,  availability,  distribution  and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse  effects  on  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  the  Company's  supply  chain  and  sales  and  distribution channels, the Company's ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company's profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is  performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company's products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,  restructuring  business  relationships,  and  ceasing  to  offer  third-party  applications  on  its  platforms.  Changing  the Company's operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  If  disputes  and  conflicts  further  escalate  in  the  future,  actions  by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company's business. Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international  disputes  could  also  have  a  negative  effect  on  consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nMany of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks  and  other  hostile  acts,  ransomware  and  other  cybersecurity  attacks,  labor  disputes,  public  health  issues,  including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting in certain  types  of  natural  disasters  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense  effects.  Such  events  can  make  it  difficult  or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose  significant  sales.  Because  the  Company  relies  on  single  or  limited  sources  for  the  supply  and  manufacture  of  many  critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.",

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming  services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers.  We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is  effectively  positioned  against,  and uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant  innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

      "answer": "U.S. export restrictions on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips could redirect demand for AI-capable semiconductors toward AMD, increasing pressure on TSMC to allocate manufacturing capacity. Since AMD relies on TSMC for its 7 nm and smaller node products and already faces risks of capacity prioritization due to limited third-party manufacturer commitments, increased demand could strain TSMC's capacity further. This may result in AMD experiencing supply constraints or delayed product introductions, especially if TSMC prioritizes other customers or faces capacity limitations due to fulfilling NVIDIA-related demand for alternative products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Quality Control: Export restrictions on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 chips have disrupted its ability to serve demand in certain markets, potentially redirecting customer demand toward competitors like AMD.",
        "Hop 2: Quality Control \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: These export controls may increase demand pressure on TSMC as customers seek alternative sources for comparable products, impacting manufacturing capacity allocation.",
        "Hop 3: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2190 AMD: AMD depends on TSMC for its 7 nm and smaller node products and faces risks if TSMC cannot meet capacity needs or prioritizes other customers, which could lead to supply constraints or delayed product introductions."

      "answer": "Intel applies Level 2 valuation inputs\u2014including non-binding market consensus prices, discounted cash flow models, and security-specific restrictions\u2014to value its financial assets, with a focus on corroborating these inputs against observable market data. This aligns with the broader framework where valuation models rely on broker/dealer quotes as observable inputs for similar instruments. Broadcom, meanwhile, explicitly references using broker/dealer quotes for investments traded less frequently, supplementing these with interest rates, yield curves, and indices. Both companies emphasize observable data, but Intel's process includes additional impairment analysis for non-marketable equity investments, which is not explicitly stated in Broadcom's disclosures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Government Incentives\n\nGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or modelderived valuations. A ll significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV  that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n- Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV  that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.\n- Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net . The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nNon-marketable equity investments and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n64",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

That culture is built upon four tangible building blocks-our beliefs, our behaviors, the way we develop and reward our people and the way we do business.\n\n## Our Beliefs and Behaviors\n\nOur leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people:\n\n- always do the right thing, in every decision and action;\n- lead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative;\n- exemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation;\n- act as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem and our communities-committed to shared success;\n- care deeply for all our people to help them achieve their aspirations professionally and personally;\n- actively innovatelooking across Accenture at what we are doing for clients and externally to partners, competitors, start-ups, clients, academia and analysts-to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same.\n\nListening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities, and that they experience a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment. We do this on an ongoing basis across various channels, including surveys and forums. One of our surveys indicates that 83% of global respondents feel comfortable being themselves at work.\n\nOur commitment to inclusion and diversity unleashes innovation and we believe creates an environment where all of our people have an opportunity to feel they belong, advance and thrive. In connection with our priorities around inclusion and diversity, we set goals, share them publicly, collect data to continuously improve and hold our leaders accountable. We are now 47% women, demonstrating continued progress on our gender parity goal by 2025. And, we are currently 28% women managing directors, which is tracking well against our goal of 30% by 2025. We are also making progress against our total workforce 2025 race and ethnicity goals in the U.S., the U.K, and South Africa, which we announced in 2020, as follows:\n\n- In the U.S., we achieved our 2025 goal with African American and Black colleagues representing 12% of our workforce. Additionally, Hispanic American and Latinx colleagues represent 11% of our workforce, which is tracking well against our goal of 13%.\n- In the U.K., we are making progress with Black colleagues representing 4.5% of our workforce compared with our 2025 goal of 7%.\n- In South Africa, we are demonstrating continued progress with African Black colleagues representing 48% of our workforce compared with our 2025 goal of 68%. Coloured colleagues represent 7% of our workforce compared with our 2025 goal of 10%.\n\nThrough the entire talent lifecycle, we are committed to being inclusive and diverse-from discovering, to hiring, to developing and advancing our people. This commitment extends to equal pay. Pay equity at Accenture means that our people receive pay that is fair and consistent when considering similarity of work, location and tenure at career level. We conduct an annual pay equity review, and our last review was conducted in November 2021. As of November 5, 2021, we had dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity for women compared to men in every country where we operate (certain subsidiaries, including recent acquisitions, and countries with de minimis headcount were excluded from the analysis). By race and ethnicity, we likewise had dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity in countries where we collect this data (the U.S., the U.K. and South Africa).\n\nWe are now\n\n28%\n\nWomen managing directors on track to achieve our goal of 30% by 2025\n\n- live our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results;\n- have the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey; and",

In contrast, Apple's trading plans, adopted by Deirdre O'Brien and Jeff Williams, allow for the sale of shares vesting between April 1, 2025, and October 1, 2026 (excluding withheld shares for O'Brien) and up to 100,000 shares of common stock plus additional shares vesting through October 1, 2025, for Williams, with expiration dates of December 31, 2026, and December 15, 2025, respectively.

      "answer": "ACN's reliance on small subcontractors with limited resources introduces execution risks, particularly during periods of global supply chain disruption, as these subcontractors may struggle to integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. This could lead to delays, increased costs, or failure to meet project requirements, especially when working with new technologies or complex client transformations. Similarly, NVDA depends on a limited number of third-party manufacturers, such as foundries and assembly/test providers, and faces risks if these manufacturers prioritize other customers\u2014like competitors in the semiconductor industry\u2014over NVDA, leading to potential production delays or supply shortages. Both companies are exposed to external execution risks, but ACN's vulnerability centers on subcontractor capability, while NVDA's stems from supplier prioritization and capacity constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "We are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business, all in a compressed timeframe. The scale and complexity of these compressed transformational projects present risks in execution. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by challenges to our intercompany transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Tax rates and policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change materially as a result of shifting economic, social and political conditions. In addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, have become more unpredictable and may become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. A number of countries where we do business, including the United States and many countries in the European Union, have implemented, and are considering implementing, changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations.\n\nThe overall tax environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly complex. The European Commission has been conducting investigations, focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. Countries around the world are also considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., various proposals to raise corporate income taxes are periodically considered. Individual countries across the globe and the European Union have either enacted or plan to enact digital taxes to impose incremental taxes on companies based on where ultimate users are located. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), a global coalition of member countries, proposed a two-pillar plan to reform international taxation. The OECD proposals aim to prevent the proliferation of separate new digital taxes and to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries by creating a new global system to tax income based on the location of users, and to impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax. There remains significant uncertainty around whether the various proposals will ultimately be enacted and, if enacted, the extent of their impact. The increased focus of the European Commission and various jurisdictions on investigations and enacting new tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by changes in the laws (or in their interpretation or enforcement) around the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes and by changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with Ireland or the United States.",

          "chunk_text": "We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis  and  at  acceptable  prices.  The  manufacturers  we  use  also  fabricate  wafers  and  ATMP  products  for  other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nOther  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  third-party  manufacturers  include  limited  control  over  delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our  intellectual  property,  dependence  on  several  subcontractors,  and  limited  ability  to  manage  inventory  and  parts. Moreover,  if  any  of  our  third-party  manufacturers  suffer  any  damage  to  facilities,  lose  benefits  under  material agreements,  experience  power  outages,  lack  sufficient  capacity  to  manufacture  our  products,  encounter  financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\n\nIf  we  transition  the  production  of  some  of  our  products  to  new  manufacturers,  we  may  experience  delayed  product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the 'Amendment'). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience  significant  delays  in  the  shipment  of  our  products,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our business.\n\nWe are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.",

These  risks  may  increase  as  our  products  are  introduced  into  new  devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.

We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field.  If  a  product liability  claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert  the  efforts  of  our  technical  and  management  personnel  and  harm  our  business.

      "question": "How does the use of matrix pricing for Level 2 securities impact the valuation transparency of ADBE's fixed-income portfolio compared to AVGO's disclosures on similar investments?",
      "answer": "ADBE values its fixed-income available-for-sale debt securities using matrix pricing techniques that rely on inputs such as benchmark yields, issuer spreads, and interest rate curves, categorizing them as Level 2 with a weighted average credit rating of AA-. Similarly, AVGO discloses that its Level 2 securities are valued using inputs like quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, and yield curves, indicating a comparable reliance on observable but non-quoted data. UPS's evidence confirms that matrix pricing is a common method for valuing Level 2 securities like corporate and municipal bonds, using market-corroborated inputs. Therefore, both ADBE and AVGO exhibit similar valuation transparency limitations tied to the indirect modeling inherent in matrix pricing, which may obscure real-time market dynamics affecting these AA-rated portfolios.",

Both companies acknowledge that market uncertainty increases the need for judgment \u2014 Cisco notes that fair value estimates can differ materially due to unobservable inputs, while Qualcomm highlights that its estimates may differ from others using different assumptions or business models.",

Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products.

Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases.

There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.\n\n## Changes  in  industry  structure  and  market  conditions  could  lead  to  charges  related  to  discontinuances  of  certain  of  our  products  or  businesses,  asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings.\n\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements  allow  us  the  option  to  cancel,  reschedule,  and  adjust  our  requirements  based  on  our  business  needs  prior  to  firm  orders  being  placed,  our  loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. From time to time we initiate restructuring plans. Our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of such plans. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n## Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.\n\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. We also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\n\n## We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\n\nOur growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\n- Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly with companies that have large and widespread operations and/or complex products (such as Splunk)\n- Diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions\n- Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles\n- Difficulties  in  entering  markets  in  which  we  have  no  or  limited  direct  prior  ex perience  and  where  competitors  in  such  markets  have  stronger  market positions\n- Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners\n- Insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions\n- The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\n\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. The occurrence of these and many other factors described in this report, and factors that we do not presently know or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Many factors affect more than one category and the factors are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\n\n## We may be unsuccessful at innovating in response to rapid technological or industry changes to meet customer needs, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\nWe operate in rapidly evolving industries and expect the pace of innovation to continue to accelerate. We must continually introduce new, and enhance existing, products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new customers. Developing new products, services and solutions is complex, requires significant investment and operational costs and may not be profitable, and our investments in new technologies are speculative and may not yield the expected business or financial benefits. The commercial success of new or enhanced products, services and solutions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development; effective distribution and marketing; market acceptance; compatibility with existing and emerging standards, platforms, software delivery methods and technologies; accurately predicting and anticipating customer needs and expectations and the direction of technological change; identifying and innovating in the right technologies; and differentiation from other products, services and solutions. If we fail to anticipate or identify technological, creative or marketing  trends  or  fail  to  devote  appropriate  resources  to  adapt  to  such  trends,  our  business  could  be  harmed.  For  ex ample,  generative  artificial  intelligence technologies enable users of all skill levels to create and provide new ways of marketing, creating content and interacting with documents, which could significantly disrupt industries in which we operate and our existing products, services and solutions and our business may be harmed if we fail to invest or adapt. While we have released new generative artificial intelligence products, such as Adobe Firefly, and are focused on enhancing the artificial intelligence ('AI') capabilities of our products and incorporating AI across existing products, services and solutions, there can be no assurance that our new or enhanced products and AI innovations will  be  successful,  adopted  or  monetizable  or  that  we  will  innovate  effectively  to  keep  pace  with  the  rapid  evolution  of AI  across  our  offerings.  If  we  do  not successfully innovate, adapt to rapid technological or industry changes and meet customer needs, our business and our financial results may be harmed.\n\n## Issues relating to the development and use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and adverse financial results.\n\nSocial, ethical and operational issues relating to the use of AI, including generative AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm, liability and additional costs. We are increasingly incorporating AI technologies, developed by us and by third parties, into many of our offerings. If our AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance is ineffective or inadequate, it may result in incidents that impair the public acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our offerings not working as intended or producing unexpected outcomes.\n\nJurisdictions around the world are developing and passing new regulations that apply specifically to the use of AI. For example, the EU AI Act was adopted in 2024 and will be implemented in phases through 2030, and other jurisdictions are considering similarly focused legislation. These regulations and the evolving AI regulatory environment may, among other impacts, result in inconsistencies among AI regulations and frameworks across jurisdictions, increase our compliance, governance and research and development costs, increase our exposure to claims related to our AI models and increase liability related to the use of AI by our customers or users that are beyond our control. While we have taken a responsible approach to the development and use of AI, such as in our Adobe Firefly offerings, there can be no guarantee that future AI regulations will not adversely impact us or conflict with our approach to AI, including affecting our ability to make our  AI  offerings  available  without  costly  changes,  delaying  or  halting  development  of  AI  offerings,  requiring  us  to  change  our  AI  development  practices, monetization strategies and/or indemnity protections and subjecting us to additional compliance requirements, regulatory action, competitive harm, reputational harm and/or legal liability. To the ex tent we rely on third-party AI models in our products, services and solutions, we will face risks inherent in how those models have been developed and deployed, including situations in which the third party may lack a proper license or consent for the training data used for their model. In addition, new competition regulations on AI development and deployment could impose new requirements on our markets that could impact our business and financial results.\n\nUncertainty around new and evolving AI uses may require significant, additional investment to develop models and proprietary datasets, responsible-use frameworks and new approaches and processes to attribute or compensate content creators. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenges accessing AI models, datasets or hardware. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost of our offerings, including due to the nature of the computing costs",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain  components for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n- Cloud  and  AI ,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and  efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n- Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including  Office,  Windows,  Teams, con sumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news  advertising),  and  the Surface line of devices.\n- Security,  Compliance,  Identity,  and  Management ,  focuses  on  cloud  platform  and  application  security,  identity  and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.\n- Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.\n- LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n- Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.",

      "question": "How does the potential impact of an Event of Default under Adobe's $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement compare to Salesforce's exposure, considering both companies' debt rating-dependent covenants and interest rate structures?",
      "answer": "Adobe's Revolving Credit Agreement allows for borrowings up to $1.5 billion, with interest rates tied to SOFR or base rate, ranging from 0.460% to 0.900% depending on debt ratings. The agreement includes covenants that, if breached, could trigger an Event of Default, leading to termination of commitments and acceleration of all amounts owed. Similarly, Salesforce has a $3.0 billion Revolving Loan Credit Agreement with interest rates ranging from 0.575% to 1.20% for SOFR loans, also dependent on compliance with covenants. Salesforce explicitly states that failure to comply with covenants could result in Events of Default, permitting acceleration of all debt and borrowings. Both companies' credit ratings directly influence their borrowing costs and covenant compliance, meaning a downgrade could increase interest expenses and potentially trigger default clauses, impacting their liquidity and financial flexibility.",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's reliance on third-party manufacturers for international semiconductor production affect its exposure to quality control risks, especially when compared to Cisco's approach to maintaining quality control through automated testing and ISO 9001-certified manufacturing processes?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA relies on third-party manufacturers located outside the United States for semiconductor wafer manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging, which exposes it to risks such as limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, and quality assurance. These risks are compounded by NVIDIA's international operations, with 56% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue coming from outside the U.S., increasing its exposure to quality control issues in external manufacturing. In contrast, Cisco maintains quality control through automated testing equipment, burn-in procedures, and comprehensive inspection and statistical process controls, with manufacturing processes generally certified to ISO 9001 standards. This indicates that while NVIDIA's supply chain dependence introduces quality control vulnerabilities, Cisco's structured and certified internal controls provide a more direct safeguard against such risks.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Third-Party Manufacturers: NVIDIA relies on third-party manufacturers outside the U.S. for semiconductor wafer manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging, with 56% of fiscal year 2024 revenue coming from international sales, increasing exposure to quality control risks.",
        "Hop 2: Third-Party Manufacturers \u2192 Quality Control: Dependence on third-party manufacturers introduces risks such as limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, and quality assurance, as seen in AMD's 10-K filing, which highlights vulnerabilities in product quality and supply chain reliability.",
        "Hop 3: Quality Control \u2190 CSCO: Cisco maintains quality control through automated testing, burn-in procedures, and ISO 9001-certified manufacturing processes, which are designed to ensure product quality and reliability."

The  management  approach  designates  the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments.\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe,  Greater  China,  Japan  and  Rest  of  Asia  Pacific.  Americas  includes  both  North  and  South  America.  Europe  includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better  align  with  the  location  of  the  Company's  customers  and  distribution  partners  and  the  unique  market  dynamics  of  each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.'\n\nThe  Company  evaluates  the  performance  of  its  reportable  segments  based  on  net  sales  and  operating  income.  Net  sales  for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those  geographic  locations.  Operating  income  for  each  segment  includes  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales  and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and development ('R&amp;D'), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,  various  nonrecurring  charges  and  other  separately  managed  general  and  administrative  costs.  The  Company  does  not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n\n## Note 2 - Revenue\n\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products. Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

As with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption  of  AI,  and  thus  our  business.  T hird-party  misuse  of  AI  applications,  models,  or  solutions,  or  ineffectiv e  or  inadequate  AI  dev elopment  or deployment practices by us or our customers, could cause harm to indiv iduals or society and impair the public's acceptance of AI.

Our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement contains various cov enants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Rev olv ing Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest cov erage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement gov erning our conv ertible notes and our Revolv ing  Credit Agreement  contains  prov isions  whereby  a  payment  default  or  acceleration  under  certain  agreements  with  respect  to  other  material indebtedness would result in cross defaults under our conv ertible indenture or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement and allow note holders or the lenders under our Revolv ing Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under certain of our indentures or the Rev olv ing Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and tend to become more stringent ov er time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that hav e enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor dev ices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less fav orable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inv entory. Jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are dev eloping or hav e finalized market entry or public  procurement  regulations  for  computers  and  serv ers  based  on  ENERGY  STAR  specifications,  and  the  like,  as  well  as  additional  energy consumption limits. Certain of our products may be excluded from some of these markets which could materially adv ersely affect us. We incur costs associated with complying with conflict minerals reporting requirements to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the EU, China and other jurisdictions  are  dev eloping  new  policies  focused  on  conflict  minerals  that  may  impact  and  increase  the  cost  of  our  compliance  program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may be unable to sufficiently v erify the origins of the subject minerals and thus our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as 'conflict free.' If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products. In addition, new or increased regulations limiting the use of such components, or regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change-related risks, could increase our energy costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities and/or necessitating that we purchase more renewable energy than otherwise planned. Our supply chain manufacturing suppliers may be exposed to increased cost of doing business should they be affected by new climate-related regulations, for example, affecting abatement equipment, renewable energy, and/or alter production processes and materials selections.\n\nIn addition to our Company, customers, gov ernments and authorities continue to focus on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. Sev eral customers hav e also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we hav e a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and av oid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our  suppliers  will  always  be  in  conformance  with  laws  and  expectations.  Our  failure  to  satisfy  customer  expectations  on  forced  and  trafficked  labor policies may result in these customers choosing a competitor's product or enforcement liability and reputational challenges.\n\nIn addition, many gov ernments hav e enacted laws around PII, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other  actions  by  the  gov ernments.  T he  GDPR  imposes  significant  requirements  on  how  we  collect,  process  and  transfer  personal  data,  as  well  as significant fines for non-compliance.\n\nNew emerging technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with ev olv ing regulations and industry standards. Giv en the complexity and rapid development of AI, there are v arious current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and serv ices. For example, the EU AI  Act  was  adopted  in  2024  and  its  implementation  will  be  phased  in  ov er  the  next  few  years.  In  other  jurisdictions,  similar  legislation  is  being considered. Such laws and regulations may impede our ability to offer certain products and serv ices in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with them. We expect that the legal and regulatory env ironment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to dev elop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may hav e a material adv erse effect on our financial condition and results  of  operations.  Gov ernments  are  also  considering  the  new  issues  in  intellectual  property  law  that AI  creates,  which  could  result  in  different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and dev elopment processes and procedures and could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business.",

      "answer": "A prolonged geopolitical conflict involving Taiwan would severely limit Qualcomm's ability to manufacture chipsets through foundry partners in the region, which is critical for its automotive semiconductor business\u2014a segment already facing long design-in time frames, stringent regulatory requirements, and high reliability standards. This disruption would increase costs and delay time-to-market for Qualcomm, exacerbating its competitive challenges in an automotive space where NVIDIA is also expanding with its own GPU-based solutions for autonomous driving and AI processing. NVIDIA, which similarly relies on Taiwanese foundries for its data center GPUs, would face supply constraints that delay product launches and impair its ability to meet surging demand for AI and generative AI workloads, particularly as it scales newer product architectures like the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips.",

We also develop and commercialize numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other devices and services, and we own substantial intellectual property related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, position location, UWB (ultra-wideband), Bluetooth , memory and component interconnect. We have also developed other technologies that are used by wireless and other devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and antenna designs, AI and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures, among other technologies. \u00ae\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuit platforms and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nAs the largest technology platform in the world, mobile has transformed the way we connect, compute and communicate. Advanced connectivity and highperformance, low-power computing technologies from mobile are also impacting many industries beyond wireless, empowering new services, new business models, and new ways to engage and interact with customers. Our breakthrough inventions and licensing programs have been integral to the demand and evolution of the mobile industry.\n\nArtificial Intelligence. Advancements in processor technologies have enabled the distribution and coordination of complex workloads across the cloud and edge devices to provide enhanced performance and efficiency across use cases. Given the proximity to raw data, edge device computing allows for more context-aware processing, reducing response time, improving privacy and security, and enabling greater personalization. With increased processing power, mobile handsets and PCs are becoming pervasive AI platforms, with complex large generative AI algorithms running on-device, enabling on-demand and contextual AI use cases at a fraction of the energy required by cloud-based applications. As wireless connectivity complements on-device generative AI, edge devices enable enhanced productivity use cases, while intelligently processing and sharing data with cloud-based applications as needed. Building on the smartphone and PC foundation, we envision generative AI becoming ubiquitous, continuing to expand into industries and applications such as IoT, XR and automotive.\n\nSignificant investment continues across many industries in the development of complex large language models (LLMs), more tailored small language models (SLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs) and other generative AI models, which are beginning to change the landscape of the user experience. LLMs and SLMs (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3) are used for text-based natural language processing applications such as answering queries, document summarization and creation, LVMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion and ControlNet) are used for image and video processing, and LMMs are used to understand and process multiple types of data inputs or modalities such as text and images. They are disrupting traditional methods of search, content creation, recommendation systems and personalized digital assistants, offering significant enhancements in consumer utility and productivity. While these generative AI models are developed primarily for use in the cloud, we believe that the variety of innovative enterprise and consumer use cases that have emerged and will continue to emerge from generative AI must run on-device to maximize their utility, and bring the benefits of immediacy, privacy, security and personalization to consumers. We expect continued advancement in the generative AI capabilities of edge devices and increased adoption of generative AI capable technologies in handsets and other edge devices. For example, analysts estimate that 46% of smartphones sold in 2027 will be generative AI capable, up from 19% in 2024 (Counterpoint, October 2024).\n\nAdvancing Connectivity. 3G technology introduced the world to the potential of the mobile internet, and the ability to access the internet virtually anytime and anywhere. 4G brought mobile broadband speeds that helped fuel the smartphone era, forever changing the way we work, live and connect with others. 4G has served as the technology foundation for many of the applications and services used today, including e-commerce, video streaming, video calling, social media and gaming.\n\nBuilding on foundational innovations developed for 3G and 4G, the mobile industry continues to transition to 5G technology as 5G network deployments and device launches continue, particularly in emerging regions. 5G is designed to support multi-gigabit data rates, low latency and greater capacity than previous generations of mobile technology to enable enhanced mobile broadband experiences, including ultra-high definition (4K) video streaming and sharing, nearinstantaneous access to cloud services, immersive cloud gaming and XR, which includes augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR). 5G's performance and capacity improvements are also enabling operators to offer new consumer and enterprise services. 5G Advanced builds upon the initial 5G standards to enhance system capabilities and expand into new use cases. It introduces key improvements for continued 5G commercialization, supports a range of services",

      "question": "How might the EAR restrictions on FPGA exports impact Intel's competitive positioning in the AI accelerator market compared to Qualcomm's exposure to similar regulatory constraints?",
      "answer": "The EAR restrictions on FPGA exports directly constrain Intel's ability to ship products like its FPGAs to China and customers with ultimate parents in D5 countries, requiring licenses or NAC notifications that may delay or prevent shipments. This limits Intel's access to key markets for its xPU products, including FPGAs that are central to its AI accelerator strategy. In contrast, while Qualcomm is subject to a broad range of U.S. export regulations like the EAR, it does not specifically mention FPGAs or AI accelerators in its risk factors\u2014instead focusing on mobile processors, automotive chips, and connectivity solutions. Therefore, Qualcomm's exposure to EAR-related disruptions in the FPGA/AI accelerator segment is less direct, giving it a potentially more favorable regulatory risk profile in this specific domain compared to Intel.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM \u2192 EAR: Qualcomm is subject to various U.S. export regulations including the EAR, which governs the export of advanced computing items, though it does not specifically highlight FPGAs or AI accelerators in its risk disclosures.",
        "Hop 2: EAR \u2192 FPGAs: The EAR specifically governs the export of AMD's and Intel's FPGAs, with restrictions preventing shipments to China or customers with ultimate parents in D5 countries without a license or NAC notification.",
        "Hop 3: FPGAs \u2190 INTC: Intel produces FPGAs as part of its xPU product family, which includes AI accelerators central to its strategy to compete in the AI computing market, making these export restrictions directly relevant to its competitive positioning."

      "answer": "Adobe categorizes all of its fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2, using pricing from independent vendors and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable market data such as benchmark yields, issuer spreads, and interest rates. In contrast, Intel's US Retiree Medical Plan invests in both Level 1 and Level 2 fixed-income instruments, with Level 1 investments measured using quoted prices in active markets and Level 2 investments valued using pricing models based on observable inputs like credit spreads and yield curves. This reflects differing approaches to fixed-income valuation, with Adobe exclusively relying on Level 2 inputs while Intel utilizes a mix of Level 1 and Level 2 inputs depending on market liquidity and availability.",

We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore categorize all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.\n\nThe fair values of our money market funds, time deposits and deferred compensation plan assets, which consist of money market and other mutual funds, are based on quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date.\n\nOur over-the-counter foreign currency derivatives are valued using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approx imate their carrying values.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nThe fair value of our senior notes was $5.51 billion as of November 29, 2024, based on observable market prices in less active markets and categorized as Level 2.

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $990 million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are no expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.\n\nThe following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n\n",

A s of December 28, 2024, we assessed the probability of paying damages to Apollo and recognized a loss of $755 million in 2024 within Interest and other, net , and a derivative liability  within Other long-term liabilities . We will periodically reassess the probability of paying such liquidated damages and recognize changes in the fair value of the underlying liability  through Interest and other, net .\n\n## Note 17 : Retirement Benefit Plans\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and certain other countries. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded non-tax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees, which had a balance of $3.3 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($2.9 billion as of December 30, 2023), recorded within other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nWe expensed $541 million in 2024, $272 million in 2023, and $489 million in 2022 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was increased from January 1 through December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 and 2022. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from M arch 1 through December 30, 2023 as compared to 2022.\n\n## US Retiree Medical Plan\n\nUpon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree M edical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the projected benefit obligations were $493 million and $490 million, which used the discount rates of 5.7% and 5.3%. The December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 corresponding fair values of plan assets were $542 million and $548 million. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the US Retiree M edical Plan was in the net asset position.\n\nThe investment strategy for US Retiree M edical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 50% equity and 50% fixed-income investments. A s of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree M edical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:\n\n",

Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely.

Oracle, on the other hand, recognizes revenue from technical support services ratably over the contractual term, which aligns with the multi-year nature of such agreements.

      "answer": "IBM's global exposure to AI regulations across 175 countries could lead to increased compliance costs and operational constraints, which may influence the broader regulatory environment and enterprise demand for AI technologies. AMD has specifically noted that new AI regulations could reduce customer demand for AI-related products, such as those enabling AI deployment. AVGO, which depends heavily on AI-related products like custom AI accelerators and XPUs for growth, faces revenue volatility if enterprise demand declines due to regulatory pressures. Therefore, IBM's regulatory exposure could indirectly affect AVGO's financial performance through a shared sensitivity to regulatory-driven demand elasticity in AI technologies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, doing business in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies, capital controls, and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, outbound investment restrictions, AI and cloud regulations, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, ex port and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company's ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.\n\nThe Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flex ibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, AI, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.\n\nIneffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\n\nThe Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, under 'Critical Accounting Estimates.' In addition, as discussed in note Q, 'Commitments &amp; Contingencies,' in IBM's 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.\n\nThe Company's Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and ex perienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the",

Even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. Some customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of the products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in product supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets such as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From ti me to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our business. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry resulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due to a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by a down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which can lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\n\n## We make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends such as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements and requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to successfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, i ncluding ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and development, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial results.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins.' These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to qualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess i nventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and i mplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for our custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur additional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the development and quality of our products and product engineering.",

      "question": "Given that Intel derived 21% of its 2021 revenue from Dell Inc., and Dell is a major recipient of Intel's platforms and components, how does AMD's reliance on third-party motherboard suppliers\u2014specifically those that may prioritize Intel-compatible designs due to Dell's market influence\u2014affect AMD's ability to secure equivalent motherboard support for its processors?",
      "answer": "Intel's 2021 revenue was significantly influenced by Dell Inc., which accounted for 21% of its total revenue, primarily from the sale of platforms and components. This strong relationship implies that Dell likely prioritizes Intel-based platforms in its product lineup. Since Dell is a major PC manufacturer, motherboard suppliers may align their design and production strategies to support Intel-compatible systems to meet Dell's demand. AMD, which depends on third-party companies for motherboard design and supply, faces challenges in securing equivalent support for its processors, as stated in its 2022 10-K filing. The filing notes that AMD\u2019s microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets intended for Intel microprocessors, meaning AMD must rely on separate motherboard development efforts. If motherboard suppliers focus more on Intel-compatible designs due to Dell\u2019s influence and Intel\u2019s dominant market position, AMD could face reduced availability or innovation in motherboards supporting its products, potentially limiting its market penetration.",

We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## If  we  lose  Microsoft  Corporation's  support  for  our  products  or  other  software  vendors  do  not  design  and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing  its  operating  systems  to  run  on  or  support  our  x86-based  microprocessor  products.  With  respect  to  our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent  software  providers  designing  and  developing  software  to  run  on  our  products.  If  Microsoft  does  not continue  to  design  and  develop  its  operating  systems  so  that  they  work  with  our  x86  instruction  sets  or  does  not continue  to  develop  and  maintain  their  operating  systems  to  support  our  graphics  products,  independent  software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by  Microsoft.  If  Microsoft  did  not  certify  a  driver,  or  if  we  otherwise  fail  to  retain  the  support  of  Microsoft  or  other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\n\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are  non-exclusive  and  permit  both  our  distributors  and  AIB  partners  to  offer  our  competitors'  products.  We  are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable  to  collect  accounts  receivable  from  our  significant  distributors  and/or AIB  partners,  it  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB  partners  or  offer  appropriate  incentives  to  focus  them  on  the  sale  of  our  products,  our  business  could  be materially adversely affected.\n\nAdditionally,  distributors  and  AIB  partners  typically  maintain  an  inventory  of  our  products.

Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\n\n## Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the  efficient  operation  of  these  processes  and  systems  is  critical  to  our  business.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nDuring 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint  ventures  with  Higon  Information  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  a  third-party  Chinese  entity.  We  did  not  recognize  a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020.\n\n## Income Taxes Provision (Benefit)\n\nWe  recorded  an  income  tax  provision  of  $513  million  in  2021  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.2  billion  in  2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers' compensation.\n\nThe income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the  U.S.  This  benefit  was  partially  offset  by  approximately  $10  million  of  withholding  tax  expense  related  to  crossborder transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits.\n\nThrough the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income.\n\n## International Sales\n\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant  portion  of  total  sales  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Substantially  all  of  our  sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion  as  of  December  26,  2020.  The  percentage  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held  domestically  was  91%  as  of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020.

      "question": "Given NVIDIA's reliance on foundry partners in Taiwan for manufacturing capacity and Broadcom's $341 million in long-lived assets located in Taiwan, how might a significant disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry impact both companies' operational capabilities based on their disclosed geographic dependencies?",
      "answer": "A significant disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry would likely impact both NVIDIA and Broadcom based on their geographic dependencies. NVIDIA explicitly states that its business depends on receiving consistent chipset supply from foundry partners in Taiwan, and a prolonged disruption would severely limit or prevent supply, having a material adverse impact on their business. Meanwhile, Broadcom reports $341 million in long-lived assets in Taiwan as of October 2023, indicating a material physical presence in the region that could also be affected by such a disruption. While the specific operational impacts would differ between the companies, both disclose meaningful dependencies on Taiwan's stability for their respective business models.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA \u2192 Foundry Partners: NVIDIA relies on foundry partners for manufacturing, and specifically notes that its business depends on receiving consistent chipset supply from Taiwan-based foundries.",

These quotes incorporate observable market data such as SOFR and swap rates, as demonstrated by the methodology used in foreign currency derivative contracts described in the link chunk. INTC, on the other hand, directly employs valuation models that explicitly use SOFR, swap rates, and other observable inputs to determine fair value for its financial instruments. While both companies rely on similar observable market inputs, TXN depends on third-party broker-dealer quotes as an intermediary, whereas INTC applies the valuation models directly, giving it more direct control over the application of these market inputs.",

If these liabilities are ultimately realized, no existing deferred tax assets in 2024 or 2023 would also be realized.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2018 and following years. Certain tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation remain pending for U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2018 through 2022.\n\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2012.\n\n## 5. Financial instruments and risk concentration\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nWe hold deriv ativ e financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair v alue of which was not material as of December 31, 2024. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024, had a notional v alue of $565 million to hedge our nonU.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $180 million to buy Indian rupee, $91 million to sell British pounds and $78 million to sell Japanese yen.\n\nOur inv estments in cash equiv alents, short-term inv estments and certain long-term inv estments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair v alue. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair v alue or net asset v alue per share. The carrying v alues for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receiv able and accounts payable, approximate fair v alue due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying v alue of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $13.60 billion, and the estimated fair v alue was $12.48 billion. The estimated fair v alue is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Lev el 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair v alue and the definition of Level 2 inputs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Level 2 Inputs\n\n## Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\n\nFor our available-for-sale debt securities, we estimate the fair values by reviewing trading activity and pricing as of the measurement date and by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Government Incentives\n\nGovernment incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, certain other receivables, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or modelderived valuations. A ll significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Equity Investments\n\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:\n\n- Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV  that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n- Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV  that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.\n- Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net . The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nNon-marketable equity investments and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n64",

      "answer": "Broadcom identifies demand fluctuations as a key risk factor that affects its revenue and gross margin, particularly due to shifts in product mix and seasonal variations. These fluctuations increase Broadcom's reliance on ecosystem partners to stabilize go-to-market strategies and maintain competitive differentiation. Similarly, Intel has strategically expanded its ecosystem partnerships to over 40 alliances across EDA, silicon IP, and design services, which has directly supported its ability to secure design wins on advanced nodes like Intel 18A. Both companies depend on ecosystem collaboration to navigate market volatility, but Intel explicitly ties its ecosystem strategy to concrete outcomes such as multigenerational agreements and accelerated interest in advanced packaging for AI-related designs.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's UK revenue exposure compare to Qualcomm's projected tax liability under the OECD's Pillar Two Framework, given the UK's implementation timeline for the 15% global minimum tax in 2024?",
      "answer": "Oracle reported $2,423 million in UK revenues in fiscal 2024, indicating a significant operational footprint in the UK. The UK is implementing the OECD's Pillar Two Framework, which introduces a 15% global minimum tax rate effective in 2024. Qualcomm has disclosed that the Pillar Two Framework may increase its effective tax rate due to changes in foreign tax jurisdictions, particularly as it earns a substantial portion of its income in the U.S. with some qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII. Unlike Oracle, which may face immediate exposure due to its UK operations, Qualcomm's liability will depend on how Pillar Two affects its global tax structure and whether its FDII deduction is reduced or eliminated over time.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL \u2192 UK: Oracle generated $2,423 million in revenue from the UK in fiscal 2024, showing a material operational presence subject to UK tax policy.",

      "question": "How might the implementation of the OECD's Pillar Two Model Rules impact Microsoft's effective tax rate in fiscal year 2025, and how does this compare to Salesforce\u2019s exposure under the same global minimum tax framework given their international operations?",
      "answer": "The OECD's Pillar Two Model Rules, which establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, are expected to apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. Although Microsoft currently estimates no material impact on its consolidated financial statements, the rules could affect its effective tax rate, which was 18% in fiscal year 2024, due to potential adjustments in foreign jurisdictions where it generates significant income. Salesforce also acknowledges exposure to the global minimum tax under Pillar Two, noting that such developments may have a material impact on its business and financial results. However, Salesforce does not provide a specific estimate of the impact, only highlighting that global tax developments, including the Pillar Two rules, could affect its cash flows and financial performance. Therefore, while Microsoft anticipates minimal direct impact, Salesforce expresses broader uncertainty, suggesting a potentially more sensitive exposure to the new tax regime.",

        "Hop 1: MSFT \u2192 Pillar Two Model Rules: Microsoft states that the OECD\u2019s Pillar Two Model Rules will apply to it starting in fiscal year 2025 and estimates no material impact on its financials, though it continues to monitor implementation.",
        "Hop 2: Pillar Two Model Rules \u2192 Global Minimum Tax: The Pillar Two Model Rules establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, intended to apply to multinational enterprises, and are being enacted in various jurisdictions.",
        "Hop 3: Global Minimum Tax \u2190 CRM: Salesforce acknowledges that global tax developments, including the global minimum tax under Pillar Two, may have a material impact on its business, cash flows, or financial results, though it does not quantify the effect."
