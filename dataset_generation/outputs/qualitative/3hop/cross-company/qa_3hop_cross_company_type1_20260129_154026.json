      "question": "How does the current zero percent setting of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) impact the total capital buffer requirements for both Morgan Stanley and American Express under Basel III, considering Morgan Stanley's inclusion of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) in its Advanced Approach calculation and American Express's explicit subjectivity to the SCB?",
      "answer": "Under the current zero percent Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB), Morgan Stanley's total capital buffer requirement under the Advanced Approach includes the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), the G-SIB capital surcharge, and the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB). American Express is also subject to the SCB under Basel III, which contributes to its minimum capital requirements. Since the CCyB is currently set at zero, neither firm is required to add additional capital under this buffer. Therefore, the SCB plays a key role in both firms\u2019 capital planning and distribution constraints, despite differing regulatory calculation approaches.",

Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic v olatility is a strategic imperativ e of the Firm's Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm's 'fortress balance sheet' philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm's capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and inv est in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed env ironments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm's capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activ ities. In addition to considering the Firm's earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a v iew to ensuring the Firm's capital strength.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objectiv e is to prov ide independent ov ersight of capital risk across the Firm.\n\nCapital Risk Management's responsibilities include:\n\n- Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;\n- Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\n- Developing processes to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches;\n- Performing assessments of the Firm's capital management activ ities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\n- Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules.\n\n## Capital management\n\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.\n\nThe primary objectiv es of the Firm's capital management are to:\n\n- Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and inv est in the Firm's businesses through normal economic cycles and in stressed environments;\n- Retain flexibility to take adv antage of future inv estment opportunities;\n- Promote the Parent Company's ability to serv e as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;\n- Ensure the Firm operates abov e the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain 'well-capitalized' status for the Firm and its principal insured depository institution ('IDI') subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;\n- Meet capital distribution objectiv es; and\n- Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm's preferred resolution strategy.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectiv es through:\n\n- Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital gov ernance framework. The internal minimum capital lev els consider the Firm's regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress ev ents;\n- Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential ev ents; and\n- Regularly monitoring the Firm's capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity lev els.\n\n## Governance\n\nCommittees responsible for ov erseeing the Firm's capital management include the Capital Gov ernance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate ('CTC') Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically rev iews the Firm's capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 91-95 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.\n\n## Capital planning and stress testing\n\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n\nThe Federal Reserv e requires the Firm, as a large Bank Holding Company ('BHC'), to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been rev iewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserv e uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Rev iew ('CCAR') and other stress testing processes to assess whether large BHCs, such as the Firm, hav e sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and hav e robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC's unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios.

      "answer": "JPMorganChase's risk governance framework emphasizes firmwide ownership of risk assessment, with Risk Management and Compliance functions overseeing risk identification and escalation across business lines and corporate functions. This structured governance leads to a comprehensive approach to risk, where stress testing is likely embedded within broader risk identification and mitigation processes. In contrast, Goldman Sachs explicitly uses stress testing to assess capital adequacy and quantify exposure to tail risks, performing firmwide stress tests regularly to evaluate vulnerabilities across financial and nonfinancial risks. The difference in emphasis\u2014JPMorganChase\u2019s governance-driven risk ownership versus Goldman Sachs\u2019s scenario-based capital adequacy focus\u2014suggests that while both firms use stress testing as a core risk tool, the integration and ultimate purpose of stress testing within their risk frameworks differ significantly.",

          "chunk_text": "Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase's business activ ities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, adv ises customers and clients on their inv estment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or serv ices, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm's overall objectiv e is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serv ing the interests of its clients, customers and inv estors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believ es that effectiv e risk management requires, among other things:\n\n- Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all indiv iduals within the Firm;\n- Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n- A Firmwide risk gov ernance and ov ersight structure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal gov ernance and independent ov ersight by the Board of Directors (the 'Board'). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm's performance ev aluation and incentiv e compensation processes.\n\n## Risk governance framework\n\nThe Firm's risk gov ernance framework inv olv es understanding driv ers of risks, types of risks and impacts of risks.\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Driv ers of risks include the economic env ironment, regulatory or gov ernment policy, competitor or market ev olution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets and natural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselv es. The Firm's risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\n\n- Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly-designed or failed business plans or an inadequate response to changes in the operating env ironment.\n- Credit and inv estment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on inv estments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk and inv estment portfolio risk.\n- Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied v olatilities, on the v alue of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\n- Operational risk is the risk of an adv erse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external ev ents impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitativ e and qualitativ e. T here may be many consequences when risks manifest themselves, including quantitativ e impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitativ e impacts such as damage to the Firm's reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm's risk gov ernance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management ('IRM') function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') appoints, subject to approv al by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the 'Board Risk Committee'), the Firm's Chief Risk Officer ('CRO') to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk gov ernance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its rev iew and approv al of the Risk Gov ernance and Ov ersight Policy.\n\nThe Firm's CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives ('FREs'), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate ('LOB CROs'), and the Firm's Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO'), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, dev elop the Firm's risk gov ernance policies and standards, and define and ov ersee the implementation of the Firm's risk gov ernance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as functions and regions. Each area of the Firm that giv es rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within the risk and control standards established by its own management.",

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nCorporate  Treasury  is  responsible  for  our  aggregated  interest  rate  risk, including  assessing  and  monitoring  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity,  and  interest rate risk stress tests and assumptions.\n\nRisk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk  officer,  has  primary  responsibility  for  assessing,  monitoring  and managing  our  interest  rate  risk  (including  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity)  by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses.\n\nStress  Testing. Stress  testing  is  a  method  of  determining  the  effect  of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures.  We  use  a  variety  of  stress  testing  techniques  to  calculate  the potential  loss  from  a  wide  range  of  market  moves  on  our  portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The  results  of  our  various  stress  tests  are  analyzed  together  for  risk management purposes. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  market  move  in  a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected  over  a  one-day  time  horizon  up  to  those  that  could  take  many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the  default  of  any  single  entity,  which  captures  the  risk  of  large  or concentrated exposures.\n\nScenario  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  specified  event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress.  When conducting  scenario  analysis,  we  often  consider  a  number  of  possible outcomes  for  each  scenario,  ranging  from  moderate  to  severely  adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\n\nUnlike V aR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated  at  a  specified  confidence  level,  there  may  not  be  an  implied probability  that  our  stress  testing  scenarios  will  occur.  Instead,  stress testing  is  used  to  model  both  moderate  and  more  extreme  moves  in underlying  market  factors.  When  estimating  potential  loss,  we  generally assume  that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n\n## Limits\n\nWe  use  market  risk  limits  at  various  levels  to  manage  the  size  of  our market exposures. These limits are set based on V aR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nLimits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk  committee,  on  a  timely  basis,  instances  where  limits  have  been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such  as  increased  volatilities  or  changes  in  correlations).  Such  instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe analyze V aR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including  by  risk  category,  business  and  region.  Diversification  effect  in the tables below represents the difference between total V aR and the sum of  the  V aRs  for  the  four  risk  categories.  This  effect  arises  because  the four  market  risk  categories  are  not  perfectly  correlated.  Substantially  all positions in VaR are included within Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## THE GOLDM AN SACHS GROUP , IN C . AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nProcesses. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our  risk  management  framework,  including  (i)  risk  identification  and assessment,  (ii)  risk  appetite,  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts,  (iii)  control monitoring and testing, and (iv) risk reporting.\n\n- Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe the identification and assessment  of  our  risks  is  a  critical  step  in  providing  our  B oard  and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality  of  our  risks.  We  have  a  comprehensive  data  collection process,  including  firmwide  policies  and  procedures  that  require  all employees  to  report  and  escalate  risk  events.  Our  approach  for  risk identification  and  assessment is  comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile  and  business  environment,  leverages  subject  matter  expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. We perform risk assessments  periodically  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  that  our  material financial  and  nonfinancial  risks  are  mitigated  through  controls  to  an acceptable tolerance level in accordance with our risk appetite. Our risk assessments  include,  among  other  things,  the  use  of  stress  testing  as well  as  an  assessment  of  our  internal  control  processes  designed  to mitigate such risks.\n\nFirmwide  stress  testing  is  an  important  part  of  our  risk  management process.  It  allows  us  to  quantify  our  exposure  to  tail  risks,  highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into our stress scenarios. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing  process.  See  'Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital  Capital Management' for further information.\n\n96\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nWe  maintain  a  daily  discipline of marking  substantially  all  of  our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems  and  in  net  revenues.  We  do  so  because  we  believe  this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and  that it provides  transparent  and  realistic insight into  our inventory exposures.\n\n- Risk Appetite, Limits, Thresholds and Alerts. We  apply  risk  limits, thresholds  and  alerts  to  control  and  monitor  risk  across  transactions, products,  businesses  and  markets.  The  Board,  directly  or  indirectly through  its  Risk  Committee,  approves  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels.  In  addition,  the  Firmwide  Risk  Appetite  Committee,  through delegated  authority  from  the  Firmwide  Enterprise  Risk  Committee,  is responsible  for  approving  our  risk  limits,  thresholds  and  alerts  policy, subject to the overall limits directly or indirectly approved by the Board, and monitoring these limits.\n\nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving and monitoring limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels  that  reflect  our  maximum  risk  appetite.  This  fosters  an  ongoing dialogue  about  risk  among  our  first  and  second  lines  of  defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of riskrelated matters. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee also authorizes Risk to set limits and thresholds to support monitoring and oversight at a more  granular  level.  For  example,  Market  Risk  sets  limits  at  certain product  and  desk  levels,  and  Credit  Risk  sets  limits  for  individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect  changes  to  our  strategic  business  plan,  as  well  as  changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. Risks limits are monitored by the respective Risk functions.",

      "question": "How does Mastercard's concern about disintermediation from fintech-developed payment platforms compare to Visa's strategic partnership approach with fintechs in the context of regulatory-driven competition in the digital payments ecosystem?",
      "answer": "Mastercard expresses concern that fintechs could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate them from digital payments, especially when sharing data under partnerships, which could give fintechs a competitive advantage. This aligns with the broader risk that fintechs may develop competitive products that replace Mastercard\u2019s offerings. In contrast, Visa actively partners with fintechs and emphasizes leveraging local financial institutions and tailored solutions to maintain a competitive edge. Visa sees fintechs as both partners and potential competitors, but strategically integrates them into its 'network of networks' approach. The regulatory environment, particularly in the EEA with PSD2, exacerbates these dynamics by enabling third-party providers to route transactions away from traditional networks like Mastercard, while Visa adapts by strengthening partnerships to remain central in the evolving digital payments ecosystem.",

Such  regulation  may  also  provide  these processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. If our customers are disintermediated in their business, we could face diminished demand for our integrated products and services.\n- Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy. When we do partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when those relationships involve sharing Mastercard data. While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standards, without proper oversight we could give the partner a competitive advantage.\n- Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete  with  or  replace  value-added  products  and  services  we  currently  provide  to  support  our  switched  transaction  and payment offerings. These products could replace our own switching and payments offerings or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these offerings. In addition, governments that develop or encourage the creation of national payments platforms may promote their platforms in such a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or require us to compete differently.\n- Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and services.\n\nOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nIn order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our Mastercard-branded cards and enabled products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts. We continue to experience pricing pressure. The demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates  and  incentives  moderates  our  growth.  We  may  not  be  able  to  continue  our  expansion  strategy  to  switch  additional transaction  volumes  or  to  provide  additional  services  to  our  customers  at  levels  sufficient  to  compensate  for  such  lower  fees  or increased costs in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.\n\nIn the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further  increase  transaction  volumes  or  the  amount  of  services  provided  thereunder  in  order  to  benefit  incrementally  from  such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.\n\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:\n\n- Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and block chain technology, machine learning and AI, could result in new technologies  that  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  we  currently  use  in  our  programs  and  services. Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and products that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products.\n- We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.",

In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further  increase  transaction  volumes  or  the  amount  of  services  provided  thereunder  in  order  to  benefit  incrementally  from  such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\n## Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.\n\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:\n\n- Technological changes, including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and block chain technology, machine learning and AI, could result in new technologies  that  may  be  superior  to,  or  render  obsolete,  the  technologies  we  currently  use  in  our  programs  and  services. Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and products that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products.\n- We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLocal  and  Regional  Networks: Operated  in  many  countries,  these  networks  often  have  the  support  of government  influence  or  mandate.  In  some  cases,  they  are  owned  by  financial  institutions  or  payment  processors. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the U.S., Interac in Canada and eftpos in Australia.\n\nDigital Wallet Providers: They continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for consumers and merchants. While digital wallets can help drive Visa volumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options.\n\nAlternative Payments Providers: These providers, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.\n\nReal-time  Payment  (RTP)  Networks: RTP  networks  have  launched  in  multiple  markets,  mainly  driven  by government sponsorship and regulatory intervention. These networks primarily focus on domestic transactions, with adoption  varying  by  use  cases  and  geographies.  They  can  compete  with  Visa  on  consumer  payments  and  other payment flows (e.g., B2B and P2P) but can be partners for value added services, such as risk management.\n\nPayment  Processors: We  compete  with  payment  processors  for  the  processing  of  Visa  transactions.  These processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result  of  regulation  in  Europe  under  the  Interchange  Fee  Regulation  (IFR),  we  may  face  competition  from  other networks, processors and other third parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nValue Added Service and New Flows Providers: We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value added services as well as new flows (e.g., Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect). This includes a wide range of  players,  such  as  technology  companies,  information  services  and  consulting  firms,  governments  and  merchant services companies. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas.\n\nWe  believe  our  fundamental  value  proposition  of  security,  convenience,  speed  and  reliability  as  well  as  the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed. In addition, we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, governments, NGOs and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions. We will continue to utilize our network of networks  strategy  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  money.  We  believe  Visa  is  well-positioned  competitively  due  to  our global brand, our broad set of payment products, new flows offerings and value added services, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  global  regulations  in  the various  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  and  services  are  used. The  most  significant  government  regulations  that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A-Risk Factors-Regulatory Risks .\n\nAnti-Corruption, Anti-Money  Laundering, Anti-Terrorism  and  Sanctions: We are  subject  to  anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to antimoney laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are included  on  OFAC's  list  of  Specially  Designated  Nationals  and  Blocked  Persons,  to  issue  or  acquire  Visa  cards  or engage in transactions using our services.",

Our  group  life  insurance  products  are  primarily  renewable  term  policies.  This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\n\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. All of these  accounts  are  at  their  minimum  crediting  rates.  Additionally,  we  experience  gross  margin  compression  from  our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression for both products.\n\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and the prevailing interest rate assumptions.\n\nRising Interest Rate Scenario. We reinvest our cash flows from our group insurance products in higher yielding assets, mitigating the impact of (i) higher interest crediting rates on, primarily, our retained asset accounts, and (ii) lower income from our derivative positions used to mitigate low interest rate margin compression.\n\n## Retirement and Income Solutions\n\nThis  business  contains  both  short-  and  long-duration  products  consisting  of  capital  market  products,  pension  risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products.\n\nThe  two  hypothetical  interest  rate  scenarios  do  not  assume  any  additional ALM  actions  we  may  take  to  preserve margins.",

Segment Information\n\nMetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\n## U.S.\n\nThe U.S. segment offers a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. The U.S. segment is organized into two businesses: Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions ('RIS'). Prior to its disposition, the Property &amp; Casualty business was included in the U.S. segment. See Note 3.\n\n- The  Group  Benefits  business  offers  products  such  as  term,  variable  and  universal  life  insurance,  dental,  group  and individual disability, vision and accident &amp; health insurance.\n- The RIS business offers a broad range of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products, including stable value and pension risk transfer products, institutional income annuities, structured settlements, longevity reinsurance solutions, benefit funding solutions and capital markets investment products.\n\n## Asia\n\nThe Asia  segment  offers  a  broad  range  of  products  and  services  to  both  individuals  and  corporations,  as  well  as  to  other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, accident &amp; health insurance and retirement and savings.\n\n## Latin America\n\nThe  Latin  America  segment  offers  a  broad  range  of  products  to  both  individuals  and  corporations,  as  well  as  to  other institutions, and their respective employees, which include life insurance, retirement and savings, accident &amp; health insurance and credit insurance.\n\n## EMEA\n\nThe  EMEA  segment  offers  products  to  individuals,  corporations,  other  institutions,  and  their  respective  employees,  which include life insurance, accident &amp; health insurance, retirement and savings and credit insurance.\n\n## MetLife Holdings\n\nThe MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that the Company no longer actively markets  in  the  United  States.  These  include  variable,  universal,  term  and  whole  life  insurance,  variable,  fixed  and  index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance.\n\n## Corporate &amp; Other\n\nCorporate &amp; Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate &amp; Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs,  internal  resource  costs  for  associates  committed  to  acquisitions  and  dispositions  and  enterprise-wide  strategic  initiative restructuring charges), interest expense related to the majority of the Company's outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal  proceedings  and  income  tax  audit  issues,  the  elimination  of  intersegment  amounts  (which  generally  relate  to  affiliated reinsurance,  investment  expenses  and  intersegment  loans  bearing  interest  rates  commensurate  with  related  borrowings),  and  the Company's investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide).\n\n## Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\n\nAdjusted earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment  reporting,  adjusted  earnings  is  also  the  Company's  GAAP  measure  of  segment  performance  and  is  reported  below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2021, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable update of $166 million, primarily in fixed annuities driven by changes to earned rates causing spread compression partially offset by favorable updates to full surrender assumptions, and updates to the Life Insurance reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees and similar features (excluding base policy liabilities and embedded derivatives) model.\n\nIn 2020, adjusted pre-tax income included a net unfavorable adjustment of $107 million, primarily in fixed annuities driven by changes to earned rates causing spread compression partially offset by favorable updates to full surrender assumptions, and in Life Insurance primarily due to mortality modeling enhancements.\n\nThe impacts related to the update of actuarial assumptions in each period are discussed by business segment below.\n\n## Individual Retirement\n\nThe annual update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net unfavorable impact to adjusted pre-tax income of Individual Retirement of $270 million and $75 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn 2021, in fixed annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $274 million which reflected lower projected investment earnings. In 2020, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $77 million which reflected lower projected investment earnings, partially offset by lower assumed lapses.\n\nIn 2021, in variable and index annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net favorable impact of $4 million, driven by lower assumed lapses. These updates were largely offset by lower projected investment earnings. In 2020, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net favorable adjustment of $2 million driven by guarantee withdrawal benefit utilization assumptions. These updates were partially offset by lower projected investment earnings.\n\n## Group Retirement\n\nIn 2021, in Group Retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $2 million, driven primarily in the variable annuities line by lower projected investment earnings, largely offset by resetting the reversion to the mean rates. In 2020, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a favorable impact of $68 million, primarily in the variable annuities line from extending the DAC amortization projection period, partially offset by updates to expense and lapse assumptions. The DAC amortization projection period was extended to reflect business still in-force at the end of the previous projection period, resulting in an increase in modeled future profits and an increase in the current DAC balance.\n\n## Life Insurance\n\nIn 2021, in Life Insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net favorable impact of $106 million, primarily driven by updates to the modeling of certain policy fees for universal life with secondary guarantees and similar features (excluding base policy liabilities and embedded derivatives), which was partially offset by lower projected investment earnings and model updates involving reinsurance. In 2020, the annual update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net unfavorable impact of $101 million, primarily driven by updates to universal life mortality assumptions. The mortality updates better align the assumptions with experience and reduce future profits which increases the reserves for affected products. The unfavorable updates were partially offset by refinements to reserve modeling.\n\n132 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the change in the fair value of securities lending agreements at Morgan Stanley compare to the corresponding reinvestment portfolio value changes at MetLife in 2023, and what does this suggest about their respective collateral reinvestment strategies?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley reported a total securities lending exposure of $38,788 million as of December 31, 2022. Meanwhile, MetLife disclosed that the estimated fair value of its securities lending agreements was $10,510 million in 2023, with a corresponding reinvestment portfolio valued at $10,553 million. This suggests that MetLife\u2019s reinvestment portfolio closely tracks the value of its securities lending agreements, indicating a tightly managed collateral reinvestment strategy. In contrast, Morgan Stanley\u2019s significantly larger securities lending exposure implies a broader or differently scaled approach to collateral management, though the specific reinvestment strategy details are not directly comparable without similar metrics from Morgan Stanley\u2019s disclosures.",

        "Hop 3: Reinvestment Portfolio \u2190 MetLife: MetLife\u2019s reinvestment portfolio is directly tied to its securities lending activities, with both metrics reported side-by-side, indicating a deliberate strategy of reinvesting received collateral."

      "answer": "The proposed 28%-30% reduction in U.S. debit interchange rate caps by the Federal Reserve could significantly lower Capital One\u2019s interchange fee income, as COF relies on interchange fees from transactions processed through four-party networks like Mastercard. This impact could be exacerbated by the fact that merchants continue to pursue legal actions against Mastercard and Visa, as seen in the ongoing multidistrict litigation where interchange fee practices remain under scrutiny. Mastercard, being subject to regulatory oversight and interchange fee limitations, may be forced to further reduce fees or face additional settlements, which would directly affect Capital One\u2019s revenue model tied to those networks.",

T he  Company has entered into a litigation management deed with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory cov ered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory cov ered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conv ersion or reduction in the conv ersion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). T he litigation management deed provides  that  the  Company  will  generally  control  the  conduct  of  the  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  subject  to  certain  obligations  to  report  and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory cov ered litigation (VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee). The VE T erritory Litigation  Management Committee, which is composed of representativ es of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory cov ered litigation.\n\nThe  Company  obtained  certain  protections  for  VE  territory  cov ered  losses  through  the  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  the  UK  loss  sharing agreement and the litigation management deed (collectiv ely Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan). T he plan cov ers VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates, where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. T he plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law  enforcement  proceedings,  only  the  interchange  litigation  specifically  cov ered  by  the  plan's terms.\n\nUnlike the U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan, the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan does not hav e an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recov er VE territory cov ered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection av ailable through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan is equiv alent to the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conv ersion rate applicable to each series of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the v alue of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The book v alue of the preferred stock reflects its historical v alue recorded at the Closing less VE territory cov ered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conv ersion rate. T he book v alue does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory cov ered losses as long as the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory cov ered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders' equity in the contra-equity account right to recov er for cov ered losses, which represents the Company's right to recov er such losses through adjustments to the conv ersion rate applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nVE territory cov ered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conv ersion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, indiv idual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conv ersion rate is made, the amount prev iously recorded in right to recov er for cov ered losses is then recorded against the book v alue of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2024, the eighth anniv ersary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee, carried out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $2.7 billion of the as-conv erted v alue from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024 (Eighth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock receiv ed a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment div ided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically conv erted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.",

      "answer": "A two-notch downgrade of JPMorgan Chase's long-term issuer rating could trigger liquidity requirements under its OTC derivatives contracts, potentially straining its financial position. This kind of rating action could also indirectly influence MetLife\u2019s capital decisions, as a broader market reaction to such a downgrade might lead to changes in rating agency criteria for equity credit, which could constitute a 'rating agency event' under MetLife\u2019s Series F Preferred Stock terms. If such an event occurs, MetLife may choose to redeem the Series F Preferred Stock at $25,500 per share (equivalent to $25.50 per Series F Depositary Share) within 90 days, in order to manage its capital structure in response to shifting regulatory or market conditions.",

A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating prov ided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements.

      "question": "How does the Federal Reserve's requirement for Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks under Dodd-Frank compare with the implications of the same act on Charles Schwab Corporation's (SCHW) prudential regulation, particularly in terms of capital adequacy and financial stability?",
      "answer": "The Federal Reserve requires Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks under the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates that bank holding companies (BHCs) support their banks during financial stress. This requirement is part of broader prudential regulations that include potential future rules yet to be finalized. Similarly, Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s expanded prudential regulation of large financial institutions, which affects its capital adequacy and risk management practices. Both companies are impacted by Dodd-Frank\u2019s emphasis on financial stability, but COF faces more direct obligations tied to its banking subsidiaries, while SCHW experiences broader regulatory scrutiny as part of systemic reform.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Source of Strength: COF is required under Regulation Y and the Dodd-Frank Act to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks, with potential future rules still pending from the Federal Banking Agencies.",
        "Hop 2: Source of Strength \u2192 Dodd-Frank Act: The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that BHCs must serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks, reflecting a systemic regulatory framework aimed at ensuring stability in the financial system.",
        "Hop 3: Dodd-Frank Act \u2190 SCHW: Charles Schwab Corporation is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s expanded prudential regulation, which includes increased oversight on capital adequacy, liquidity, and risk management for large financial institutions."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFDIC may jointly determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the Company were to fail to adequately address deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in a timely manner, it may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. In July 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC ex tended the deadline for the next full resolution submission from March 31, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required by FDIC regulation to submit its own resolution plan to the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule amending the resolution plan submission requirements applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank. Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the LTD Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Regulation Y  requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (this is known as the 'source of strength doctrine'). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and further requires the Federal Banking Agencies to jointly adopt rules implementing this requirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority.\n\n## FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ('DIF') maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio ('DRR') for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "Stress Tests and Capital Planning. The FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and  Review  (CCAR)  is  designed  to  ensure  that  large  BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times  of  economic  and  financial  stress.  As  required  by  the  FRB,  we perform  an  annual  capital  stress  test  and  incorporate  the  results  into  an annual  capital  plan,  which  we  submit  to  the  FRB  for  review.  See 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital  Capital  Management  -  Capital  Planning  and  Stress  Testing  Process'  in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital  plan.  As  described  in  'A vailable  Information'  below,  summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions  across  a  range  of  macroeconomic  and  company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB's own stress tests. In December 2024  and  February  2025,  the  FRB  indicated  that  it  intends  to  propose significant changes to the stress test framework in 2025 and, for the 2025 stress  test,  take  steps  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  results  and  to  begin  to improve  model  transparency.  Also  in  December  2024,  trade  groups representing  major  U.S.  banks,  including  us,  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the FRB concerning certain inadequacies with its stress testing process.\n\nUnder the FRB's rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated  assets,  including  us,  the  SCB  applies  to  the  Standardized approach capital requirements. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends.  The  SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission  of  a  capital  plan.  See  'A vailable  Information'  below  and 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital'  in Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Form  10-K  for  information  about  our  SCB requirement.\n\nThe  SCB  rule  requires  a  BHC  to  receive  the  FRB's  approval  for  any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit  its  capital  plan,  which  may  occur  if  the  BHC  determines  there has  been  or  will  be  a  'material  change'  in  its  risk  profile,  financial condition  or  corporate  structure  since  the  plan  was  last  submitted,  or  if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan.\n\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more  that  are  subsidiaries  of  U.S.  G-SIB s,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA,  are required  to  submit  annual  company-run  stress  test  results  to  the  FRB . GSBE  also has its own  capital and stress testing process,  which incorporates  internally  designed  stress  tests  and  those  required  under German  regulatory  requirements  and  the  ECB  Guide  to  Internal  Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally  designed  stress  tests  developed  in  accordance  with  the  PRA 's ICAAP guidelines.\n\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal and state laws impose  limitations  on  the  payment  of  dividends  by U.S.  depository institutions,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA.  In  general,  the  amount  of  dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the  recent  earnings  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  if  the  total  of  all dividends  declared  by  the  entity  in  any  calendar  year  is  in  excess  of  the current  year's  net  income  combined  with  the  retained  net  income  of  the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the  undivided  profits  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  in  excess  of  the entity's undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been  paid  out  as  dividends  or  transferred  to  surplus),  unless  the  entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval.\n\nThe applicable  U.S.  banking  regulators  have  authority  to  prohibit  or  limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n\nSource  of  Strength. The  Dodd-Frank  Act  requires  BHCs  to  act  as  a source  of  strength  to  their  U.S.  bank  subsidiaries  and  to  commit  capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the  FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to  provide  it.  Capital  loans  by  a  BHC  to  a  U.S.  subsidiary  bank  are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness  of  the  subsidiary  bank.  In  addition,  if  a  BHC  commits  to  a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source-ofstrength  authority  or  in  response  to  other  regulatory  measures,  that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.",

      "question": "How does the absence of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer impact the minimum capital requirements for SCHW compared to GS's TLAC to RWAs requirement, given both are subject to multi-layered regulatory buffers?",
      "answer": "For SCHW, the absence of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (which was set to zero) still results in a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 7.0%, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8.5%, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 10.5%, inclusive of other buffers like the 2.5% stress capital buffer. For GS, the TLAC to RWAs requirement includes a 18% minimum, a 2.5% buffer, and also incorporates the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (also set to zero), along with a 1.5% G-SIB surcharge. Therefore, even without the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, both firms face layered capital requirements, but GS's baseline (18%) is significantly higher due to its global systemic importance and TLAC framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\n## Recent accounting guidance\n\nIn  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ('FASB')  issued  ASU  2020-04, Reference  Rate  Reform (Topic  848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . This amended guidance provides transition relief for the accounting impact of reference rate reform. For a limited period, this guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying  GAAP  to  certain  contract  modifications,  hedging  relationships,  and  other  transactions  affected  by  a  reference  rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The amended guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Our exposure to London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') is primarily limited to an insignificant portion of our available-for-sale debt securities  and,  accordingly,  we  do  not  expect  reference  rate  reform  to  have  a  material  impact  on  our  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers  on  our  payments  platform  and  from  other  value  added  services.  Our  revenues  are  classified  into  two  categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a  fixed  and  variable  component. The  variable  component  is  generally  a  percentage  of  the  value  of  the  payment  amount  and  is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement  when  the  underlying  transaction  is  approved  for  a  refund.  We  estimate  the  amount  of  fee  refunds  that  will  be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform,  which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV').  We  earn  additional  fees  on transactions  where  we  perform  currency  conversion,  when  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already  provided.  Our  contracts  generally  renew  automatically  without  any  significant  material  rights.  Some  of  our  contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs and we do not carry any material contract balances.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using  our  risk  assessment  tools,  we  perform  a  transaction  risk  assessment  on  individual  transactions  to  determine  whether  a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of  completing  a  payment  transaction. As  a  principal  to  the  transaction,  we  control  the  service  of  completing  payments  on  our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How has the adoption of ASU 2022-02 affected MET's loan modification disclosures compared to JPM's reporting under the legacy TDR guidance, particularly in terms of the types and financial impact of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty?",
      "answer": "MET adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, which eliminated the TDR accounting framework and introduced the concept of Financial Difficulty Modifications (FDMs), requiring expanded disclosures. MET reported that the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial statements, but it now discloses FDMs instead of TDRs. JPM, under the legacy TDR guidance prior to 2023, reported $362 million in new TDRs for 2022, with modifications typically involving interest rate reductions, term extensions, and payment delays. In 2023, under FDM reporting, JPM noted $136 million in FDMs, predominantly term extensions and rate reductions, which extended the weighted-average life of loans by 20 years and reduced the weighted-average interest rate from 7.21% to 4.44%. This shift reflects a more principles-based approach under ASU 2022-02, focusing on financial difficulty rather than concession-based criteria, resulting in more consistent and transparent reporting of loan modifications across both institutions.",

      "answer": "At Mastercard, both A Class (voting) and B Class (non-voting) shares have dividend rights, indicating equal treatment in shareholder returns through dividends despite differences in voting power. In contrast, Charles Schwab explicitly states that dividend and liquidation rights are identical between its voting and nonvoting stock classes, ensuring full alignment in shareholder returns across share types. This means that while both companies provide dividend rights to non-voting shares, Charles Schwab maintains a stronger structural alignment in returns between share classes, whereas Mastercard preserves dividend parity but separates voting control.",

      "answer": "MET's Structured Products, which include RMBS, are part of a broader category that also encompasses ABS & CLO and CMBS, making it impossible to isolate RMBS' exact percentage of MET's total fixed maturity securities. In contrast, AIG explicitly reports RMBS as 7% of its total fixed maturity securities in 2024. This suggests that AIG maintains a more transparent and direct exposure to RMBS, while MET's exposure is embedded within a more diversified structured products portfolio, potentially masking the specific RMBS proportion and indicating a different approach to managing residential mortgage-related risk.",

Investments\n\nSee Note 13 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\n\n## Investment Risks and Uncertainties\n\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL and impairments, the recognition of income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to these financial statement risks may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\nThe  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  (e.g.  structured  securities,  including  mortgage-backed  securities,  ABS  &amp;  CLO,  certain  structured  investment transactions and FVO securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\n\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock.

Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to a much lesser extent, general obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. Commercial mortgage-backed securities ('CMBS') primarily includes securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans.

As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's v iew, representativ e of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.\n\nTo prov ide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is maintained.

      "answer": "JPMorgan utilizes credit default swaps (CDS) as part of its credit portfolio management, aiming to purchase protection with maturity dates that align with the exposures being hedged. However, mismatches in maturity or credit events between the CDS and actual exposures can lead to earnings volatility. In contrast, Bank of America employs ECL models that forecast principal cash flows using the contractual terms of commercial loans, including adjustments for expected prepayments and borrower behavior in open-ended commitments. This suggests that while JPMorgan focuses on external instruments like CDS with maturity alignment goals, Bank of America integrates contractual terms directly into internal risk modeling at the loan level, reflecting different strategic approaches to managing credit exposure and volatility.",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's use of credit default swaps (CDS) to hedge default risk relate to Capital One's reliance on default rate assumptions in valuing their net derivative assets, given the sensitivity of both institutions to credit event outcomes?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley actively uses credit default swaps (CDS) to hedge against the risk of default on debt obligations, entering into contracts where it receives or provides protection against credit events such as bankruptcy or failure to pay. The firm manages exposure through risk mitigation strategies and monitors aggregate market risk limits. Meanwhile, Capital One values its net derivative assets using discounted cash flow models that depend heavily on unobservable inputs, including a weighted average default rate assumption of 4% with a range of 53\u2013163%. The connection between the two lies in the systemic sensitivity both institutions have to default outcomes: Morgan Stanley\u2019s CDS contracts are triggered by defaults, directly affecting its derivative liabilities, while Capital One\u2019s valuation models depend on projected default rates, meaning actual deviations from these assumptions would materially impact the fair value of its derivative assets. Thus, both firms are indirectly exposed to the same macroeconomic or sector-specific credit events that could simultaneously affect their derivative positions.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Default: Morgan Stanley uses CDS contracts to hedge against default risk on debt obligations, with exposure directly tied to credit events like bankruptcy or restructuring.",

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fix ed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest ex pense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixedvariable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $109 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2023. Operating revenues decreased $206 million primarily due to lower gas cost recovery, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses decreased $390 million primarily due to a $412 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $88 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt ex pense, energy efficiency programs, and revenue taxes. The decrease in net income also includes an increase of $46 million in income taxes primarily as a result of higher pre-tax  earnings and an increase of $36 million in interest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Pipeline Investments\n\nThe gas pipeline investments segment consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nThe gas marketing services segment provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $11 million, or 12.1%, compared to 2023. The increase was due to a $43 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating revenues primarily due to lower retail margins.",

We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives, such as market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\n\n- A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n- Information about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n- The statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedging relationships for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nSee  '-  Summary  of  Critical  Accounting  Estimates  -  Derivatives'  for  further  information  on  the  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  derivatives.  See  also 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures - Hedging Activities' for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\n\n## Net Derivative Gains (Losses)\n\nA portion of our derivatives are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\n\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits are accounted for as MRBs and measured at estimated fair value. We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees.\n\nWe continuously review and refine our hedging strategy in light of changing economic and market conditions, evolving NAIC and the NYDFS statutory requirements, and accounting rule changes. As a part of our current hedging strategy, we maintain portfolio level derivatives in our macro hedge program. These macro hedge program derivatives mitigate the potential deterioration in our capital positions from significant adverse economic conditions.\n\nSee '- Results of Operations - Consolidated Results' for an analysis of the year-over-year changes in net derivative gains (losses).\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Overview\n\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the following sections included elsewhere herein for additional information regarding the topics noted below:\n\n- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n- Note 3 (acquisitions and dispositions);\n- Note 5 (funding agreements, reported in PABs and the related pledged collateral);\n- Note 16 (long-term debt, short-term debt, credit and committed facilities, and debt and facility covenants);\n- Note 17 (collateral financing arrangement and the related pledged collateral);\n- Note 18 (junior subordinated debt securities and the related replacement capital covenant); and\n- Note  19  (preferred  stock  and  common  stock,  including  the  calculation  and  timing  of  dividend  payments,  restrictions  on  dividends,  'dividend  stopper' provisions, and MetLife, Inc.'s common stock repurchase authorizations).\n- Notes to the MetLife, Inc.

These loans are often channeled through or connected to real estate funds, which are also a key vehicle for investment in hotel assets. MetLife, on the other hand, holds $13.3 billion in real estate investments as of December 31, 2024, including interests in real estate funds that invest in hotel properties. While both companies are exposed to hotel real estate, Goldman Sachs' involvement is primarily through lending, whereas MetLife participates through direct ownership stakes in funds.

Our ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loan investments with dissimilar risk characteristics, such as collateral dependent loans, individually and on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in earnings within net investment gains (losses) in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loan investments that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loan investments being presented at the net amount expected to be collected.\n\nIn determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over contractual terms of mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or ex pected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL.\n\n## Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\n\nOur real estate investments are comprised of wholly-owned properties, and interests in both real estate joint ventures and real estate funds which invest in a wide variety of properties and property types, consisting of single and multi-property projects, and are broadly diversified across multiple property types and geographies.\n\nThe carrying value of our real estate investments was $13.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, or 2.9% of cash and invested assets, at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio had appreciated to a $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion unrealized gain position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess our real estate investments for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the real estate may be impaired.

We have direct exposure to market risk. In addition, market risk may also impact our clients and markets in a manner that may indirectly impact us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk-Market Risk.'\n\n## Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors.\n\nOur results  of  operations  have  been  in  the  past  and  may,  in  the  future,  be materially  affected  by  global  financial  market  and  economic  conditions, including, in particular, by periods of low or slowing economic growth in the United  States and other major markets, both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels. These include the level and volatility of equity,  fix ed  income  and  commodity  prices;  the  level,  term  structure  and volatility of interest rates; inflation, currency values and unemployment rates; the  level  of  other  market  indices,  fiscal  or  monetary  policies  established  by governments, central banks and financial regulators; and uncertainty concerning  the  future  path  of  interest  rates,  government  shutdowns,  debt ceilings or funding, which may be driven by economic conditions, recessionary fears, market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related incidents, acts of war or aggression, geopolitical  instability,  changes  as  a  result  of  global  elections,  including changes in U.S. presidential administrations or Congress, changes to global trade policies, supply chain complications and the implementation of tariffs, protectionist  trade  policies,  trade  sanctions  or  investment  restrictions  and other factors, or a combination of these or other factors.\n\nThe  results  of  our  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity  and  in  the  fair  value  of  securities  and  other  financial  products. Fluctuations  also  occur  due  to  the  level  of  global  market  activity,  which, among other things, can  be  impacted  by  market  uncertainty  or  lack  of  investor  and  client confidence due to unforeseen economic, geopolitical or market conditions that in  turn  affect  the  size,  number  and  timing  of  investment  banking  client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, including equity market levels and the level and pace of changes in interest rates and asset valuation, may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets, including deposits. This could also impact the level of net new asset flows and/or  flows  into  fee-based  assets. Any  of  these  factors  could  negatively impact the results of our Wealth Management business segment.\n\nSubstantial market fluctuations or divergence in asset performance could also cause  variations  in  the  value  of  our  investments  in  our  funds,  the  flow  of investment capital into or from AUM, and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which  could  negatively  impact  the  results  of  our  Investment  Management business segment.\n\nThe value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets  may  make  it  difficult  to  value  and  monetize  certain  of  our  financial instruments, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance-based income (also  known  as  incentive  fees,  which  include  carried  interest)  in  respect  of certain  businesses.  In  addition,  at  the  time  of  any  sales  and  settlements  of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid  depreciation  in  asset  values  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly ex posed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses. Although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk  to  more  ex treme  market  moves,  severe  market  events  have  historically been  difficult  to  predict,  and  we  could  realize  significant  losses  if  ex treme market events were to occur.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves.

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new  or  amended  laws,  rules  and  regulations;  designs  and  implements controls,  policies,  procedures  and  training;  conducts  independent  testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads  our  responses  to  regulatory  examinations,  audits  and  inquiries.  W e monitor  and  review  business  practices  to  assess  whether  they  meet  or exceed minimum  regulatory and legal standards in all  markets  and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\n\n## Conflicts Management\n\nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental  to  our  client  relationships,  our  reputation  and  our  long-term success.  The  term  'conflict  of  interest'  does  not  have  a  universally accepted  meaning,  and  conflicts  can  arise  in  many  forms  within  a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.\n\nWe  have  a  multilayered  approach  to  resolving  conflicts  and  addressing reputational  risk.  Our  senior  management  oversees  policies  related  to conflicts  resolution  and,  in  conjunction  with  Conflicts  Resolution,  Legal and  Compliance,  and  internal  committees,  formulates  policies,  standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts.  Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular  situation  and  the application of experienced and informed judgment.\n\n126\n\nGoldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nAs a general matter,  Conflicts  Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments  in  Global  Banking  &amp;  Markets  and  certain  of  our  investing, lending  and  other  activities.  In  addition,  we  have  various  transaction oversight committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer.\n\nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest  in  an  effort  to  conduct  our  business  in  accordance  with  the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nReputational risk is the potential risk that negative publicity regarding our business  practices,  whether  true  or  not,  will  cause  a  decline  in  our customer  base,  costly  litigation  or  revenue  reductions.  Our  reputation  is critical  to  effectively  serving  our  clients  and  fostering  and  maintaining long-term client relationships, and it is integral to how we are viewed by our key stakeholders.\n\nIn  evaluating  business  opportunities,  reputational  risk  is  one  of  the  most significant components we consider. We evaluate the ethics, suitability and transparency of transactions undertaken by us. Our  employees are responsible  for  considering  the  reputational  impacts  that  our  business activities may have.\n\nWe  have  implemented  a  comprehensive  program  designed  to  monitor reputational  risk.  The  Firmwide  Reputational  Risk  Committee,  which reports  into  the  Firmwide  Enterprise  Risk  Committee,  is  responsible  for assessing  reputational  risks  arising  from  business  opportunities  that  have been  identified as having  potential heightened reputational risk.  This committee is also responsible for overseeing client-related business standards  and  addressing  client-related  reputational  risk  and  considers, among  other  things,  the  potential  effects  any  business  opportunities, products, transactions, new activities, acquisitions, dispositions or investments could have on our reputation.\n\nFor further information about our risk management  processes, see 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' and 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.",

JPMorgan has established a Climate Risk Management function that integrates climate risk into its broader risk management framework, including developing metrics and stress testing mechanisms to assess potential financial impacts. According to Morgan Stanley\u2019s disclosures, compliance risk includes exposure to legal sanctions or reputational damage from failure to meet climate-related regulatory requirements, such as increased disclosure mandates or carbon taxes.

Certain merchants and merchant-affiliated groups hav e been exerting their influence in the global payments system in certain jurisdictions, such  as  the  U.S., Australia,  Canada  and  Europe,  to  attempt  to  lower  acceptance  costs  paid  by  merchants  to  acquirers  or  their  agents  to  accept payment products or serv ices, by lobbying for new legislation, seeking regulatory interv ention, filing lawsuits and in some cases, surcharging or refusing to accept Visa products. If they are successful in their efforts, we may face increased compliance and litigation expenses, issuers may decrease their issuance of our products, and consumer usage of our products could be adv ersely impacted. For example, in the U.S., certain stakeholders hav e raised concerns regarding how payment security standards and rules may impact debit routing choice and the cost of payment card acceptance. In addition to ongoing litigation related to the U.S. migration to EMV-capable cards and point-of-sale terminals, U.S. merchant-affiliated groups and processors hav e expressed concerns regarding the EMV certification process and some policymakers hav e expressed concerns about the roles of industry bodies such as EMVCo and the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in the dev elopment of payment card standards. Additionally, many merchants have advocated for lower acceptance costs in the form of reduced interchange rates, which could result in some issuers eliminating or reducing their promotion or use of Visa's products and serv ices, eliminating or reducing cardholder benefits such as rewards programs, or charging account holders increased or new fees for using Visa-branded products, all of which could negativ ely impact Visa's transaction v olumes and related rev enue. Finally, some merchants and processors have advocated for changes to industry practices and Visa acceptance requirements at the point of sale, including the ability for merchants to accept only certain types of Visa products, to mandate only PIN authenticated transactions, to differentiate or steer among Visa product types issued by different financial institutions, and to impose surcharges on customers presenting Visa products as their form of payment. If successful, these efforts could adv ersely impact consumers' usage of our products and decrease our ov erall transaction v olumes and net rev enue, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation that increases our compliance and litigation expenses, and ultimately harm our business.\n\n## We  depend  on  relationships  with  financial  institutions,  acquirers,  processors,  merchants,  payment  facilitators,  ecommerce  platforms, fintechs and other third parties.\n\nAs  noted  abov e,  our  relationships  with  industry  participants  are  complex  and  require  us  to  balance  the  interests  of  multiple  third  parties.  For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to prov ide  our  products  and  serv ices,  and  thereby  compete  effectiv ely  in  the  marketplace.  We  offer  incentiv es  to  merchants,  acquirers,  ecommerce platforms  and  processors  to  encourage  routing  preference  and  acceptance  growth.  We  also  engage  in  many  payment  card  co-branding  efforts  with merchants,  who  receiv e  incentiv es  from  us. As  emerging  participants  such  as  fintechs  enter  the  payments  industry,  we  engage  in  discussions  to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, merchant, ecommerce platform or digital wallet prov ider. As these and other relationships become more prev alent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain  and  grow  these  relationships.  In  addition,  we  depend  on  our  clients  and  third  parties,  including  network  partners,  v endors  and  suppliers,  to submit, facilitate and process transactions properly, prov ide v arious serv ices associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to  our  operating rules and applicable laws. As our clients expand their global footprint, their legal and regulatory obligations can become ev en more complex. From time to time, our relationships may be affected by actions of our clients and industry participants that may materially and adv ersely impact our business, products or serv ices, and to the extent we or such parties fail to perform or deliv er adequate serv ices or comply with regulatory obligations, it may result in negativ e experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation.\n\n## Our business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation.\n\nOur brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business.

Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk, to produce accurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs. If our Framework is ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition. Also, any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on incorrectly designed or implemented models or AI could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the data, models and AI used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. In addition, regulation of AI is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies. The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, privacy, data protection and data security, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI is the subject of ongoing review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various U.S. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations to AI or are considering general legal frameworks for AI. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore, because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational, competitive or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\n\n## Fraudulent activity associated with our products could cause our fraud losses to increase, the use of our products to decrease and our brands to suffer reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, customers and other third parties handling customer information. The risk of fraud continues to be a persistent inherent risk for the financial services industry. Credit and debit card fraud, identity theft and electronic-transaction related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated. Emerging generative AI capabilities, such as synthetic voice and conversation generation, introduced an increase in fraud risks, especially in the form of identity fraud. While we have policies and procedures designed to address such risk, there can be no assurance that losses will not occur. Our resources, customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately predict, prevent or detect fraud. Consumer activists and regulators have sought to expand financial institutions' responsibility to hold customers harmless for fraudulent transactions that they authorized on their accounts.\n\nOur risk of fraud continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our digital banking business and introduce new products and features. Our financial condition, the level of our fraud charge-offs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. Furthermore, high-profile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention or other actions (such as mandatory card reissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brands, which could negatively impact the use of our deposit accounts and cards and which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risk\n\nCompliance with new and existing domestic and foreign laws, regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex, and any significant changes may adversely affect our business.\n\nA wide array of laws and regulations, including banking, tax and consumer lending laws and regulations, apply to every aspect of our business and these laws can be uncertain and evolving. We and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators both in the U.S. and abroad, and the manner in which our regulators interpret applicable laws and regulations may affect how we comply with them.\n\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations and effectively navigate this complex regulatory landscape, even if the failure is inadvertent, results from human error or reflects a difference in interpretation or conflicting legal requirements, could subject\n\n35\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

In such a case, BAC\u2019s exposure would be tied to the performance of the underlying reference entity and the structure of the CDO, which may include tranches that absorb losses sequentially.

The  Corporation  routinely securitizes  loans  and  debt  securities  using  VIEs  as  a  source  of  funding  for  th e Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities  to  third  parties.  The  assets  are  transferred  into  a  trust  or  other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities.

In addition, the Corporation also enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances.

The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $36 million pretax loss related to net investment hedges, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings (recorded in Other revenue ).\n\n## Credit Derivatives\n\nCiti is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions.\n\nCiti manages counterparty credit risk arising from credit derivative contracts primarily through master netting agreements, collateral agreements and daily margin settlement requirements. A majority of Citi's top 15 counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral.\n\nThe range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-linked notes.\n\nA credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount.\n\nA total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer.\n\nA credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity. For ex ample, in a credit spread option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified 'strike' spread level. The option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity.\n\nA credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity. Thus, the max imum amount of the note purchaser's exposure is the amount paid for the credit-linked note.",

Cash equivalents, which comprise of money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\n\nLevel 2 assets. Collective  investment funds are unregistered investment vehicles that generally commingle the assets of multiple fiduciary clients, such as pension and other employee benefit plans, to invest in a portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. Although the collective investment funds held by the plan are ultimately invested in publicly traded equity and debt securities, their own unit values are not directly observable, and therefore they are classified as Level  2.  Equity  funds  are  investments  in  mutual  funds  that  in-turn  ultimately  invest  in  equity  securities  of  various jurisdictions. These are classified as level 2 as the equity funds held by the plan are not actively traded but the fair value of underlying securities are generally, although not always, determined with observable data and inputs. The fair values of corporate debt, multi-asset and U.S. government-sponsored securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets.\n\nLevel  3  assets. Asset-backed  securities  are  bonds  that  are  backed  by  various  types  of  assets  and  primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are classified as Level 3 due to a lack of observable inputs in measuring fair value.",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan's $4 million increase in Average Total VaR, driven by credit protection purchased against retained loans, relate to its involvement in CDOs compared to Bank of America's $65 million exposure to consolidated CDOs?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan reported a $4 million increase in Average Total VaR for 2024, partly due to credit protection purchased against retained loans and lending-related commitments. This credit protection is linked to CDOs, which are hybrid instruments where credit protection is sold to the issuer. In contrast, Bank of America disclosed a $65 million maximum loss exposure to consolidated CDOs at the end of 2024, reflecting its direct involvement in structuring and holding securities from these vehicles. The comparison highlights how both institutions are exposed to CDO-related credit risks, but with differing magnitudes and structural roles.",

There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 202 4, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by  issuing  multiple  tranches  of  debt  and  equity  securities.  CDOs  are  generally managed  by  third-party  portfolio  managers.  The  Corporation  typically  transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation's maximum  loss exposure to consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled  $65  million  and  $80  million  at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors,  invests  in  or  provides  financing,  which  may  be  in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real  estate,  d eb t  securities  or  oth er  financial  instruments  and   are  d esigned   to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31,  202 4  and  2023,  the  Corporation's  consolidated  investment  VIEs  had  total assets of $6 million and $472\n\nmillion.  The  Corporation  also  h eld   investments  in  unconsolidated  VIEs  with  total assets of $23.0 billion and $18.4 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The Corporation's  maximum  loss  exposure  associated  with  both  consolidated  and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31,  202 4  and  2023  comprised  primarily  of  on-balance  sheet  assets  less  nonrecourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net  investment  in  consolidated  leveraged  lease  trusts  totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The trusts hold longlived  equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and  commercial  aircraft.  The  Corporation  structures  the  trusts  and  holds  a significant  residual  interest.  The  net  investment  represents  the  Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is nonrecourse to the Corporation.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maximum loss exposure and assets held by the Corporation  that  related  to  oth er  asset-backed  VIEs  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and 2023.\n\n## Other Asset-backed VIEs\n\n",

      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase is subject to Dodd-Frank regulations that govern its use of derivatives through enforceable set-off and close-out netting provisions under ISDA Master Agreements, which are constrained by the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) under Title II of Dodd-Frank. Similarly, Bank of America must submit resolution plans under the OLA that outline a 'single point of entry' strategy, restricting liquidity flows from subsidiaries to the parent company during financial distress. Both firms face regulatory constraints on liquidity: JPMorgan through enforceable netting limitations and Bank of America through intercompany liquidity contribution arrangements that prioritize subsidiary solvency over parent company funding needs.",

        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 Dodd-Frank: JPMorgan Chase is subject to Dodd-Frank regulations that govern its derivatives transactions, including enforceable netting and set-off rights under ISDA Master Agreements.",
        "Hop 2: Dodd-Frank \u2192 Orderly Liquidation Authority: Dodd-Frank's Title II establishes the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which constrains how financial institutions can manage credit risk and close-out netting in the event of bankruptcy or resolution.",

JPMorgan, on the other hand, sells credit protection through credit-related notes, where the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation upon a credit event. Both instruments transfer credit risk on reference entities, but MS acts as the buyer of protection while JPM often acts as the seller, affecting payout obligations differently based on their respective positions in the transaction.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit deriv ativ es are financial instruments whose v alue is deriv ed from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit deriv ativ es expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit ev ent, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receiv es a premium for prov iding protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\n\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit deriv ativ es market and uses these deriv ativ es for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm activ ely manages a portfolio of credit deriv ativ es by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit deriv ativ es to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and deriv ativ es counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm's marketmaking businesses. Following is a summary of v arious types of credit deriv ativ es.\n\n## Credit default sw aps\n\nCredit deriv ativ es may reference the credit of either a single reference entity ('single-name'), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared deriv ativ e contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&amp;P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit ev ent, then the reference entity that defaulted is remov ed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure lev els: for example, to prov ide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a\n\n$10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\n\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit ev ent, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face v alue of the CDS contract and the fair v alue of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit deriv ativ e contract, also known as the recov ery v alue. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receiv e amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit ev ent occurs.\n\n## Credit-related notes\n\nA credit-related note is a funded deriv ativ e with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note inv estor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the inv estor pays the issuer the par v alue of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the inv estor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the inv estor the par v alue of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit ev ent. If a credit ev ent occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par v alue of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the inv estor the difference between the par v alue of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.\n\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit deriv ativ es and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Upon a credit ev ent, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recov ery v alue of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit deriv ativ es bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio cov erage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through creditrelated notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit protection against certain loans in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit deriv ativ es and credit-related notes.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. Credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.\n\nDirect and indirect credit exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, securities purchased under agreements to resell and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain General Insurance businesses. A IG's credit risk management framework defines credit risk processes to identify, evaluate, risk rate, measure, manage and govern credit risk across the enterprise and to ensure the consistency of those processes.\n\nWe monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as parental or third-party guarantees, simultaneous payment provisions or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit, funds withheld accounts and cash or securities held in trust collateral accounts.\n\nFor additional information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures, see Investments - Investment Strategies - Available-for-Sale Investments.\n\n## Derivative Transactions\n\nWe utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. Credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. A ll derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by ERM . We evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the AIG Credit Policy and, where necessary, we require credit enhancements for certain transactions and enter into offsetting and netting arrangements.\n\nFor additional information related to derivative transactions, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, inflation, and their respective levels of uncertainty. It can also be brought on by political turmoil, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. We are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability  sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nMarket risk is overseen at the corporate level within ERM  through the CRO. M arket risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively , and in partnership with ERM . The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is monitored through multiple lenses that include economic, GAAP and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation, in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. This process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments. We use a number of approaches to measure market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and stress testing.\n\n82\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## THE GOLDM AN SACHS GROUP , IN C . AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nCorporate  Treasury  is  responsible  for  our  aggregated  interest  rate  risk, including  assessing  and  monitoring  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity,  and  interest rate risk stress tests and assumptions.\n\nRisk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk  officer,  has  primary  responsibility  for  assessing,  monitoring  and managing  our  interest  rate  risk  (including  EaR  and  EVE  sensitivity)  by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses.\n\nStress  Testing. Stress  testing  is  a  method  of  determining  the  effect  of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures.  We  use  a  variety  of  stress  testing  techniques  to  calculate  the potential  loss  from  a  wide  range  of  market  moves  on  our  portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The  results  of  our  various  stress  tests  are  analyzed  together  for  risk management purposes. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.\n\nSensitivity  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  market  move  in  a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected  over  a  one-day  time  horizon  up  to  those  that  could  take  many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the  default  of  any  single  entity,  which  captures  the  risk  of  large  or concentrated exposures.\n\nScenario  analysis  is  used  to  quantify  the  impact  of  a  specified  event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress.  When conducting  scenario  analysis,  we  often  consider  a  number  of  possible outcomes  for  each  scenario,  ranging  from  moderate  to  severely  adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\n\nUnlike V aR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated  at  a  specified  confidence  level,  there  may  not  be  an  implied probability  that  our  stress  testing  scenarios  will  occur.  Instead,  stress testing  is  used  to  model  both  moderate  and  more  extreme  moves  in underlying  market  factors.  When  estimating  potential  loss,  we  generally assume  that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n\n## Limits\n\nWe  use  market  risk  limits  at  various  levels  to  manage  the  size  of  our market exposures. These limits are set based on V aR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about the limit approval process.\n\nLimits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk  committee,  on  a  timely  basis,  instances  where  limits  have  been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such  as  increased  volatilities  or  changes  in  correlations).  Such  instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe analyze V aR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including  by  risk  category,  business  and  region.  Diversification  effect  in the tables below represents the difference between total V aR and the sum of  the  V aRs  for  the  four  risk  categories.  This  effect  arises  because  the four  market  risk  categories  are  not  perfectly  correlated.  Substantially  all positions in VaR are included within Global Banking &amp; Markets.\n\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\n\n",

The first is 'quantitative' and involves the use of loss forecasting models based upon various statistical analyses with adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions, which includes expected economic conditions. The second is 'qualitative' and involves factors that represent management's judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Auditing the allowance for the credit card portfolio was especially challenging and highly judgmental due to the significant judgment required in establishing certain components of the qualitative element. The qualitative element requires management to make judgments regarding current and forward-looking conditions, internal and external factors, and uncertainty as it relates to economic, model, or forecast risks, where not already captured in the modeled results.   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit         | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the ACLprocess, including, among others, controls over the development, operation, and monitoring of loss forecasting models and management review controls over key assumptions and qualitative judgments used in reviewing the final credit card allowance results. Our tests of controls included observation of certain of management's quarterly ACL governance meetings, at which key management judgments, qualitative adjustments, and final ACLresults are subjected to critical challenge by management groups independent of the group responsible for producing the ACLestimate. Our audit response included evaluating the comprehensive framework of the ACL, which involved engaging EYSpecialists to evaluate the model methodology, model performance and model governance, as well as the conceptual soundness of certain qualitative elements. We also performed testing on data inputs utilized in the qualitative element calculation, as well as

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs manages $113.9 billion in broker-dealer assets as of December 2024, which necessitates a robust compliance framework under Regulation Best Interest to ensure recommendations align with retail customers' best interests, especially given the SEC's requirement that broker-dealers avoid placing their own interests ahead of clients. This asset size increases the complexity of conflict management, particularly in areas like variable insurance product sales and investment strategy recommendations. Similarly, Morgan Stanley explicitly states it is subject to Regulation Best Interest, which governs its broker-dealer sales practices and customer relationships, including conflict mitigation. Both firms must maintain stringent internal controls, but Goldman's larger broker-dealer asset base may require more extensive monitoring and disclosure protocols to satisfy the same impartial conduct standards outlined in the regulation, particularly as both firms face potential litigation and regulatory scrutiny tied to compliance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Standards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\n\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the 'DOL'), the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\nThe prohibited transaction rules of  ERISA and the  Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to  ERISA plans and participants and to  Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\n\nIn  2021,  the  DOL 's  final  version  of  the  prohibited  transaction  ex emption  ('PTE')  2020-02  went  into  effect,  which  allows  investment  advice  fiduciaries  to  receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of 'fiduciary' for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of 'fiduciary' and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors.\n\nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products.\n\nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms 'advisor' or 'adviser' without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\n\nIn  January  2025,  the  Chilean  Congress  approved  a  major  pension  reform  bill,  which  improves  pensions  by  increasing  employer  contributions,  correcting  certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile's Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.",

The SEC and other supervisory bodies generally have broad administrative powers  to  address  non-compliance,  including  the  power  to  restrict  or  limit MSSB from carrying on its investment advisory and other asset management activities.\n\nThe  Firm  is  subject  to  various  regulations  that  affect  broker-dealer  sales practices  and  customer  relationships,  including  the  SEC's  'Regulation  Best Interest,' which requires broker-dealers to act in the 'best interest' of retail customers at the time a recommendation is made without placing the financial or  other  interests  of  the  broker-dealer  ahead  of  the  interest  of  the  retail customer.\n\nMargin lending by our broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal Reserve's restrictions  on  lending  in  connection  with  purchases  and  short  sales  of securities.  Our  broker-dealers  are  also  subject  to  maintenance  and  other margin requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules.\n\nOur U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the  SEC's net capital rule and  the  net  capital  requirements  of  various  ex changes,  other  regulatory authorities  and  self-regulatory  organizations.  For  more  information  about these requirements, see Note 16 to the financial statements.\n\nResearch Regulation. In addition to research-related regulations currently in place  in  the  U.S.  and  other  jurisdictions,  regulators  continue  to  focus  on research conflicts of interest and may impose additional regulations.\n\nFutures Activities and Certain Commodities Activities Regulation. MS&amp;Co. and E*TRADE Futures LLC, as futures commission merchants, and MSSB, as an introducing broker, are subject to net capital requirements of, and certain of their activities are regulated by, the CFTC  and  the National Futures Association  ('NFA').  MS&amp;Co.  is  also  subject  to  requirements  of,  and regulation by, the CME Group, in its capacity as MS&amp;Co.'s designated selfregulatory organization, and various commodity futures exchanges of which MS&amp;Co. is  a  member.  Rules  and  regulations  of  the  CFTC,  NFA,  the  Joint Audit  Committee  and  commodity  futures  exchanges  address  obligations related to, among other things, customer asset protections, including rules and regulations governing the segregation of customer funds, the use by futures commission merchants of customer funds, the margining of customer accounts and documentation entered into by futures commission merchants with their customers,  record-keeping  and  reporting  obligations  of  futures  commission merchants and introducing brokers, risk disclosure and risk management. Our commodities activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nDerivatives Regulation. We are subject to comprehensive regulation of our derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose margin requirements, public and regulatory reporting, central clearing and mandatory trading on regulated exchanges or execution  facilities  for  certain  types  of  swaps  and  security-based  swaps (collectively, 'Swaps').\n\nCFTC and SEC rules require registration of swap dealers and security-based swap  dealers,  respectively,  and  impose  numerous  obligations  on  such registrants,  including  adherence  to  business  conduct  standards  for  all  inscope Swaps. We have registered a number of U.S. and non-U.S. swap dealers and  conditionally  registered  a  number  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S  security-based swap dealers. Swap dealers and security-based swap dealers regulated by a prudential regulator are subject to uncleared Swap margin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the prudential regulators. Swap dealers  and  security-based  swap  dealers  not  subject  to  regulation  by  a prudential regulator are subject to uncleared Swap margin requirements and minimum capital requirements established by the CFTC and SEC, respectively. In some cases, the CFTC and SEC permit non-U.S. swap dealers and securitybased swap dealers that do not have a prudential regulator to comply with applicable non-U.S. uncleared Swap margin and minimum capital requirements instead of direct compliance with CFTC or SEC requirements.\n\n## Investment Management\n\nMany of the subsidiaries engaged in our investment management activities are registered  as  investment  advisers  with  the  SEC.  Many  aspects  of  our investment management activities are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations in place primarily for the protection of the investor or client. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from carrying on our investment management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition, certain of our subsidiaries are U.S. registered broker-dealers and act as distributors to our proprietary mutual funds and as placement agents to certain  private  investment  funds  managed  by  our  Investment  Management business segment. Certain of our affiliates are registered as commodity trading advisors  and/or  commodity  pool  operators,  or  are  operating  under  certain exemptions from such registration pursuant to CFTC rules and other guidance, and have certain responsibilities with respect to each pool they advise. Our investment management activities are subject to additional laws and regulations, including restrictions on sponsoring or investing in, or maintaining certain other relationships with, covered funds, as defined by the Volcker  Rule,  subject  to  certain  limited  ex emptions.

      "answer": "The UK's proposed increase in required liquidity levels for money market funds could constrain PayPal's access to short-term liquidity instruments, increasing its cost of capital and requiring greater reserves to support transaction volumes. This regulatory change directly impacts PayPal\u2019s liquidity risk management strategy, especially as it seeks to scale real-time payment flows through partnerships like Visa\u2019s upcoming UK A2A solution. Visa\u2019s A2A platform will facilitate immediate bank-to-bank transfers, which may accelerate PayPal\u2019s need for real-time liquidity availability while also increasing exposure to fluctuating liquidity costs driven by the new UK rules.

In 2023, C alifornia passed several laws requiring certain com panies doing business in C alifornia to publish certain types of clim ate-related disclosures, and other states m ay adopt sim ilar laws.\n\nThe E U  has enacted num erous sustainability regulations, including (1) the Sustainable F inance D isclosure R egulation, requiring sustainability-related disclosures by financial market participants; (2) the E U  T axonom y R egulation, requiring asset m anagers to report against an E U -wide taxonom y of environm entally sustainable activities and m ake detailed disclosures relating to E SG  characteristics of funds and portfolios; (3) the C orporate Sustainability R eporting D irective (\"C SR D \"), requiring enhanced sustainability reporting for E U -based and E U -listed com panies, and from  2028, for a wider group of global com panies; and (4) the C orporate Sustainability D ue D iligence D irective (\"C SD D D \"), requiring in-scope E U  com panies and certain non-E U  com panies to m anage actual or potential adverse im pacts of their activities and their supply chains on hum an rights and environm ental m atters. T he E uropean C om m ission ('E C ') is reviewing and m ay am end aspects of the C SR D , C SD D D  and E U  T axonom y R egulation. M eanwhile, the U K continues to work on im plem entation of its Sustainability D isclosure R equirem ents.\n\nThe E U  and the U K F inancial C onduct Authority ('F C A') have issued rules and guidelines on the use of E SG  or sustainability related term s in fund nam es. In addition, the E U adopted regulations on E SG  rating providers applicable in m id-2026 while the U K is expected to propose new legislation on E SG  rating providers. Japan and Singapore have published codes of conduct for E SG  data and rating providers, with H ong Kong considering a sim ilar approach, while India introduced a regulatory fram ework for E SG  rating providers in July 2023.\n\nAs jurisdictions continue to develop and im plem ent sustainability regulations and litigation challenging such regulations increases, BlackR ock faces greater fragm entation risk related to local application of regulations, resulting in com plex and conflicting com pliance obligations and legal and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nGlobal regulatory reform s could require BlackR ock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be tim e-consum ing and increase costs, including costs related to regulatory com pliance, result in litigation, im pede the C om pany's growth and cause its AU M , revenue and earnings to decline. R egulatory reform  m ay also im pact BlackR ock's clients, which could cause them  to change their investm ent strategies or allocations in m anners that m ay be adverse to BlackR ock.\n\n## Regulatory reforms in the US expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.\n\nI n recent years, a num ber of regulatory reform s have been proposed or fully or partially im plem ented in the U S, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackR ock is subject has increased. BlackR ock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and m eet the requirem ents that such regulatory reform s im pose. N ew or proposed changes to laws, regulations, policies, initiatives and other governm ent actions m ay be difficult to anticipate, which provides additional uncertainty and m ay heighten the C om pany's risks related to such actions. W hile BlackR ock is, and m ay becom e, subject to num erous reform initiatives in the U S, see I tem  1, Business - Regulation , key regulatory reform s that m ay im pact the C om pany include:\n\n\u00b7 Antitrust Rules and Guidance: I n O ctober 2024, the F ederal T rade C om m ission ('F T C '), with concurrence from  the Antitrust D ivision of the D epartm ent of Justice (the 'D O J') approved am endm ents to rules enacted under the H art-Scott-R odino Antitrust Im provem ents Act of 1976 ('H SR ') that require parties in certain transactions to provide the F T C  and DOJ prior notice and observe a waiting period before consum m ation of such transactions. The final am endm ents significantly expanded the inform ation required to be reported and docum ents to be subm itted in connection with an H SR  filing, which will likely substantially increase any pre-m erger notification expenses and m ay delay transactions. In Decem ber 2023, the FTC  and D O J also jointly issued new m erger guidelines, which could im pact (1) the ability of the C om pany to expand its services through strategic investm ents or acquisitions and (2) funds that engage in transactions reportable under H SR .\n\n\u00b7 Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution ('SIFI'): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIF Is in the U S under the D oddFrank Wall Street R eform  and C onsum er P rotection Act of 2010. In N ovem ber 2023, the F SO C  finalized am endm ents to its existing interpretive guidance to rem ove the prioritization of an activities-based approach over an entity-specific approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks to financial stability, although the am endm ent clarified that the F SO C  retained the ability to use an activities-based approach when appropriate. If BlackR ock is designated as a SIF I, it could becom e subject to enhanced regulatory and capital requirem ents and direct supervision by the F ederal R eserve.\n\n\u00b7 SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Sw aps: I n 2021, the SE C  proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps ('SBS') transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions, which, if adopted as proposed, m ay affect the types of transactions BlackR ock m ay choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and im pact the liquidity in the SBS m arkets in which BlackR ock transacts.",

Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets, liquidity needs due to unanticipated reductions in customer balances, or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\n## If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed.\n\nOur reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or criticism from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media, advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions, internal policies, or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating results may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\n\nOur key metrics are  calculated  using  internal  company  data  based  on  the  activity  we  measure  on  our  payments  platform  and  compiled  from  multiple  systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance ('ESG') issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\n\nVarious jurisdictions are adopting or considering new laws and regulations that expand mandatory disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements with respect to ESG matters. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations concerning ESG  matters or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other  enforcement  actions,  and  our  business  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  affected.  If  our  ESG -related  data,  processes  and  reporting  are  viewed  as incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG -related goals on a timely basis or at all, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders (including those in support of or in opposition to ESG principles) may have a negative view of us to the extent we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to their ESG  concerns or take positions that are contrary to their views or ex pectations.\n\nWe recognize that climate-related risks may impact our business. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, extreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, flooding, heat waves, and wildfires. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n26",

      "question": "How does BlackRock's compliance with the UK's Overseas Fund Regime (OFR), which requires EU consumer protection equivalence for marketing funds, create different operational challenges compared to AIG's personal insurance operations in the UK under the broader regulatory reforms introduced by FSMA 2023?",
      "answer": "BlackRock must ensure that consumer protection regimes in EU countries where its funds are domiciled are deemed equivalent to the UK's standards under the OFR, which is a requirement for marketing funds in the UK through simplified registration. This creates a dependency on third-country regulatory alignment and increases compliance complexity for BlackRock\u2019s UK market access. In contrast, AIG operates in the UK personal insurance market, which is subject to FSMA 2023 reforms that include changes to financial promotion regimes, market infrastructure, and conduct regulation. These reforms require AIG to adapt its accident and health, and personal lines insurance offerings to meet new UK-specific regulatory expectations. While both companies face increased regulatory scrutiny under FSMA 2023, BlackRock\u2019s challenge centers on cross-border fund marketing compliance, whereas AIG must adjust its insurance product frameworks and distribution strategies to align with evolving UK domestic regulation.",

      "question": "How does Schwab's interest rate hedging strategy in 2024 indirectly affect the reported value of Citigroup's mortgage servicing rights, given the documented inverse relationship between low interest rates and MSR valuations?",
      "answer": "Schwab executed $15.0 billion of receive-fixed swaps in 2024 to hedge against lower interest rates, which reflects their strategic positioning in a low-rate environment. Low interest rates are explicitly documented to reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), as seen in JPMorganChase\u2019s 10-K. Citigroup reported a net balance of $760 million for mortgage servicing rights in its 2024 financial statements. Therefore, Schwab\u2019s hedging implies continued market expectations of low rates, which in turn would place downward pressure on Citigroup\u2019s MSR valuation as reflected in its balance sheet.",

(1)\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, S chw ab executed $15.0 billion of receive-fixed sw aps on CS C's S enior Notes to reduce interest expense exposure in a low er interest rate environment. (2)\n\nAFS and HTM securities comprised approximately 48% and 54% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated effective duration of the remaining balance sheet assets in aggregate was less than one year as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Economic Value of Equity Simulation\n\nManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, and includes the impact of derivative instruments. While EVE does not have a direct accounting relationship, the measure aims to capture a theoretical value of assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate environments. EV E is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, behavior of non-maturity client cash held on the balance sheet, and pricing assumptions. We use both proprietary and independent thirdparty models to simulate EVE sensitivity and related analyses. We develop and maintain client credits and deposits run-off models internally based on historical experience and prevailing client cash realignment behaviors. We rely on third-party models for interest rate term structure modeling, prepayment speed modeling for mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans, and cash flow projections based on interest income, and contractual maturities.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effectiv e, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market ev ents were to occur.\n\n## Credit\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and gov ernment entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can inv olv e JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses",

Meanwhile, Schwab holds MetLife's Series F Preferred Stock, which includes a defined 'rating agency event' provision that allows MetLife to redeem the stock at $25,500 per share (plus accrued but unpaid dividends) within 90 days of such an event. This means Schwab could face early redemption of its Series F Preferred Stock if a rating agency downgrades MetLife or changes criteria in a way that reduces equity credit assigned to the security.

      "question": "How does the structure of Citigroup's indemnification obligation to Brighthouse, supported by GE's capital maintenance agreement with UFLIC, affect MetLife's contingent liability exposure related to the Travelers long-term care insurance policies?",
      "answer": "MetLife spun off its retail insurance business, including the Travelers long-term care insurance (LTC) policies, to Brighthouse in 2017. Under the original reinsurance agreement, Genworth assumed obligations for these policies and reinsured them through UFLIC, a GE subsidiary. GE supports UFLIC\u2019s obligations via a capital maintenance agreement, ensuring UFLIC has sufficient funds to meet its reinsurance commitments. Citigroup, which sold Travelers to MetLife in 2005, indemnifies MetLife (now Brighthouse) for any losses related to the LTC policies if both Genworth (and by extension UFLIC) fails to perform and the Genworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable. As of December 31, 2024, no liability is reflected on Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet for this indemnification, as the likelihood of both events occurring is not probable. Therefore, MetLife\u2019s contingent liability exposure related to the Travelers LTC policies is effectively transferred to Brighthouse and indirectly supported by Citigroup\u2019s indemnification, which is itself contingent on UFLIC and Genworth failing to meet their obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Long-Term Care Insurance: MetLife acquired the Travelers LTC policies through its 2005 acquisition and later spun off this business to Brighthouse in 2017.",
        "Hop 2: Long-Term Care Insurance \u2192 UFLIC: UFLIC, a subsidiary of GE, reinsured the LTC policies from Genworth after GE's spin-off of Genworth in 2004, with GE providing a capital maintenance agreement to ensure UFLIC can meet its reinsurance obligations.",
        "Hop 3: UFLIC \u2190 C: Citigroup indemnifies MetLife (now Brighthouse) for any LTC policy losses if both UFLIC/Genworth fail to perform and the Genworth Trusts are insufficient, though no liability is recognized on Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet as of 2024 due to the low probability of both events occurring."

The Company believes  the  presentation  of  adjusted  earnings  enhances  its  investors'  understanding  of  its  performance  by  highlighting  the  results  of  operations  and  the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\n\nAdjusted earnings focuses on the Company's primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, and (iv) other adjustments. Also, adjusted earnings excludes results of discontinued operations under GAAP.\n\nMarket volatility can have a significant impact on the Company's financial results. Adjusted earnings for the Company's segments excludes net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), MRB remeasurement gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. Further, net investment income excludes adjusted earnings adjustments relating to joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, and policyholder benefits and claims exclude (i) changes in the discount rate on certain annuitization guarantees accounted for as additional liabilities and (ii) market value adjustments.\n\nAsymmetrical and non-economic accounting adjustments are made in calculating adjusted earnings for the Company's segments:\n\n- Net investment income includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n- Other revenues include settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and exclude asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n- Policyholder benefits and claims excludes (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of  FPBs, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments, (iii) asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance, and (iv) non-economic  losses  incurred  at  contract  inception  for  certain  single  premium  annuity  business.  These  losses  are  amortized  into  adjusted  earnings  within policyholder benefits and claims over the estimated lives of the contracts.\n- Policyholder liability remeasurement gains (losses) excludes asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "As part of GE's spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth through GE's Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit indirectly from the ex istence of the capital maintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\n\nIn connection with Citi's 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder claims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the G enworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over time.\n\nIf both (i) G enworth fails to perform under the original Travelers/G E Life reinsurance agreement for any reason, including its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform under its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the capital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two Genworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi, through its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi would become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such events occurring is currently not probable, there is no liability reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to this indemnification. However, if both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but less than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\n\n## Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing\n\nCiti provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 24 for a discussion of Citi's derivatives activities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs. This ex cess cash is then held at depository institutions such as banks or carry brokers.\n\nThere are two types of margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\n\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi's bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was approximately $14.9 billion and $17.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nVariation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the client's derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is ex posed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client's derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client's positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi's credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform.\n\nAs required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on Citi's Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Market Risk Rule\n\nThe 'Market Risk Rule' supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading book. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'Part II \u4e00 Item 7. MD&amp;A \u4e00 Market Risk Profile' for additional information.\n\n## Basel III Finalization Proposal\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking ('Basel III Finalization Proposal') to revise the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would introduce a new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets ('Expanded Risk-Based Approach'). An institution subject to the proposal would be required to calculate its risk-weighted assets under both the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the existing Basel III standardized approach and, for each risk-based capital ratio, would be bound by the calculation that produces the lower ratio. All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer requirement, would apply regardless of whether the Expanded Risk-Based Approach or the existing Basel III standardized approach produces the lower ratio. The proposal would also replace the existing approach for calculating market risk with a new approach based on both internal models and standardized methodologies.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would also make certain changes to the calculation of regulatory capital for Category III and IV  institutions. Under the proposal, these institutions would be required to begin recognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1 capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The proposal would also generally reduce the threshold above which these institutions must deduct certain assets from their CET1 capital, including certain deferred tax  assets, mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a proposed effective date of July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period ending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted assets calculated under the Ex panded Risk-Based Approach and the recognition of AOCI in CET1 capital would be phased in. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the Basel III Finalization Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ('FDICIA') requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take PCA for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized; adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution. The capital categories relate to FDICIA's PCA provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank's overall financial condition or prospects.\n\nFor an insured depository institution to be well capitalized, it must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a leverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for Category III and certain other institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments\n\n## Basel III Revisions\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame (capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital requirements. Citi continues to monitor developments related to this rulemaking, including as a result of new leadership at the U.S. banking agencies.\n\nThe capital proposal would maintain the current capital rule's dual-requirement structure for RWA, but would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit risk and operational risk components of RWA. The capital proposal would also replace the current market risk framework with a new standardized methodology and a new models-based methodology for calculating RWA for market risk. Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new ex panded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio for determining the binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based approach is designed to align with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to determine credit, market and operational RWA amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the capital proposal's impact on RWA amounts would also affect several other requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB surcharge under method 2 (see 'GSIB Surcharge' below). The proposal has a three-year transition period that would begin July 1, 2025. If finalized as proposed, the capital proposal would materially increase Citi's required regulatory capital.\n\nFor information about risks related to changes in regulatory capital requirements, see 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks,' '-Operational Risks' and '-Compliance Risks' below.\n\n## GSIB Surcharge\n\nSeparately on July 27, 2023, the FRB proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk indicators and shortening the time to come into compliance with each year's surcharge. In addition, the proposal would narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands.\n\n## Long-Term Debt Requirements\n\nOn August 29, 2023, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the TLAC rule to change the haircuts (i.e., the percentage reductions) that are applied to eligible long-term debt. Under the proposed rule, only 50% of eligible long-term debt with a maturity of one year or more but less than two years would count toward the TLAC requirement, instead of the current 100%. These proposed revisions are estimated to decrease the TLAC percentage of Advanced Approaches RWA as well as the TLAC percentage of Total Leverage Exposure. The proposed rule in its current form has no proposed transition period for its implementation and is not expected to be material to Citi.",

      "question": "How does the value of securities loaned with maturities of 31-90 days at Goldman Sachs compare to the total securities loaned value reported by Morgan Stanley, and what does this suggest about their relative exposure to short-term securities lending risk?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs reports $1,634 million in securities loaned with maturities of 31-90 days, while Morgan Stanley reports a total of $281 million in securities loaned (U.S. and Non-U.S. combined). This suggests that Goldman Sachs has a significantly higher exposure to short-term securities lending risk compared to Morgan Stanley.",

      "question": "How does Citi's governance structure for managing compliance risk specifically address the potential amplification of credit and liquidity risks stemming from transition climate risks as outlined in Morgan Stanley's risk disclosures?",
      "answer": "Citi's governance structure includes the Board and Executive Management Team, which oversee enterprise risk management (ERM) and hold management accountable for the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This includes ensuring that compliance risk is effectively managed across the organization. Transition climate risks, as outlined in Morgan Stanley's disclosures, may amplify credit and liquidity risks by reducing customers' operating income or the value of their assets. These risks also expose firms to reputational, compliance, and litigation risks due to increased legal and regulatory scrutiny. Citi\u2019s Internal Audit, which reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit Committee, provides independent assurance over the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and controls, including those addressing climate-related risks. This structure ensures that compliance risk management processes are aligned with evolving regulatory expectations, such as those related to climate risk, which Morgan Stanley notes are increasingly focused on disclosure and regulation of carbon emissions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit\n\nInternal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit and reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit Committee and administratively to Citi's CEO. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and issues identified through Internal Audit's activities.\n\n## Enterprise Support Functions\n\nEnterprise support functions engage in activities that support safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in maintaining an effective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions are composed of Human Resources and Global Legal Affairs and Compliance (exclusive of ICRM, which is part of the second line of defense). Front line units may also include enterprise support units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the Controllers Group within Finance).\n\nEnterprise support functions, units and activities are subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).\n\n## Risk Governance\n\nCiti's ERM Framework encompasses risk management processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi's commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk management practices.\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi's risk appetite.\n\n## Executive Management Team\n\nThe Citigroup CEO directs and oversees the day-to-day management of Citi as delegated by the Board of Directors. The CEO leads the Company through the Executive Management Team and provides oversight of group activities, both directly and through authority delegated to committees established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure continued alignment with Citi's risk strategy.\n\n## Board and Executive Management Committees\n\nThe Board executes its responsibilities either directly or through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its oversight and risk management responsibilities:\n\n- Audit Committee : assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to (i) the integrity of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements, financial reporting process and systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (ii) the performance of the internal audit function (Internal Audit), (iii) the annual independent integrated audit of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of Citigroup's internal control over financial reporting, the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Auditors) and the evaluation of the Independent Auditors' qualifications, independence and performance, (iv) holding management accountable for the effectiveness of Citigroup's control environment and status of corrective actions, including the timely remediation of control breaks (including, without limitation, significant compliance or operational control breaks), (v) policy standards and guidelines for risk assessment and risk management, (vi) Citigroup's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures and (vii) the fulfillment of the other responsibilities set out in the Audit Committee's Charter.\n- Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee : is responsible for overseeing compensation of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and Citi management's sustained focus on fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible conduct and accountability within the organization. The Committee regularly reviews Citi's management resources and the performance of senior management. The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and approving the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and members of Citi's Ex ecutive Management Team. The Committee is also responsible for approving the incentive compensation structure for other members of senior management and certain highly compensated employees (including discretionary incentive awards to covered employees as defined in applicable bank regulatory guidance), in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee from time to time. The Committee also has broad oversight over compliance with bank regulatory guidance governing Citi's incentive compensation.\n- Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee : is responsible for (i) identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending to the Board the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board's performance, (iii) recommending to the Board directors for each committee for appointment by the Board, (iv) reviewing the Company's policies and programs that relate to public issues of significance to the",

ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the 'DOL'), the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\nThe prohibited transaction rules of  ERISA and the  Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to  ERISA plans and participants and to  Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\n\nIn  2021,  the  DOL 's  final  version  of  the  prohibited  transaction  ex emption  ('PTE')  2020-02  went  into  effect,  which  allows  investment  advice  fiduciaries  to  receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of 'fiduciary' for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of 'fiduciary' and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors.\n\nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products.\n\nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms 'advisor' or 'adviser' without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\n\nIn  January  2025,  the  Chilean  Congress  approved  a  major  pension  reform  bill,  which  improves  pensions  by  increasing  employer  contributions,  correcting  certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile's Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.",

Pursuant to the definition and the SEC's and CFTC's interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries, other than stable value contracts, might also be treated as swaps. Special federal banking rules apply to certain derivatives contracts and other agreements with some banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally limit or delay the rights of counterparties upon the insolvency of such banking institutions which could increase our counterparty risk.\n\nIn  2024,  the  principal  U.S.  federal  banking  regulatory  agencies  reproposed  for  public  comment  regulations  to  implement  certain  international  'Basel  III'  capital standards, which could affect capital charges applicable to banks and their affiliates engaged in derivatives activities. This could increase the costs of our risk mitigation using derivatives, as well as impact the availability of derivatives from our counterparties.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency  to  submit  for  clearing  eligible  secondary  market  transactions  in  U.S.  Treasury  securities.  The  rule  effectively  requires  such  participants  to  clear  eligible  cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the rule effectively requires eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to be cleared beginning on June 30, 2026. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule's potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\n\n## Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\n\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that meet the definition of a 'security,' including variable annuity contracts and variable  life  insurance  policies,  and  certain  fix ed  interest  rate  or  index -linked  contracts  with  features  that  require  them  to  be  registered  as  securities  or  ex empt  from registration. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\n\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered 'securities' under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\n\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies with separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 'Investment Company Act') or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One of our insurance subsidiaries issues a fix ed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered under the Securities Act.\n\nCertain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nTwo of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose and adopt rules and regulations that impact broker-dealers and products deemed to be securities. One of our U.S. broker-dealers serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of these variable products and other securities offerings. Our broker-dealer distributes these products via unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that sell these products to end investors. Under SEC rules, these selling broker-dealers are required to comply with various SEC and FINRA rules and regulations, including Regulation Best Interest. SEC rules also require these selling broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a 'best interest' standard for the sale of annuities. All of our insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states have adopted the model regulation or another form of the best interest standard.",

      "answer": "Company C reports holding $49,549 million in credit card loans due within 1 year, indicating a significant portion of short-term consumer credit exposure. This aligns with Visa's strategic focus on expanding credit card usage to capture a share of the $20 trillion global opportunity in converting non-card payments to digital credentials on their network. Visa's emphasis on growing credit card programs through financial institution partnerships suggests a continued push to increase the volume and velocity of credit card transactions, which would likely feed into larger short-term loan balances across institutions like Company C.",

      "answer": "AXP relies on internal credit models and third-party valuations for its Level 3 investment securities, which include debt securities from Community Development Financial Institutions and an embedded derivative in GBT JerseyCo Limited valued using Monte Carlo simulations. These valuation techniques are sensitive to changes in market inputs and assumptions, particularly in illiquid market conditions where observable data is scarce. JPM_10k_2024.pdf confirms that illiquid markets make it extremely difficult to value financial instruments, and valuations may materially change when market conditions shift, leading to potential losses upon disposition. MS_10k_2024.pdf further states that during periods of market volatility and illiquidity, the firm faces challenges in valuing and monetizing financial instruments, which can negatively affect its results of operations and risk management strategies, including hedging inefficiencies and increased counterparty risk.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nFor the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table above), we apply the following valuation techniques:\n\n## Investment Securities\n\nWhen available, quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are used to estimate fair value. Such investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWhen quoted prices of identical investment securities in active markets are not available, the fair values for our investment securities are obtained primarily from pricing services engaged by us, and we receive one price for each security. The fair values provided by the pricing services are estimated using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on observable market inputs or recent trades of similar securities. Such investment securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The inputs to the valuation techniques applied by the pricing services vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, benchmark security prices, credit spreads, prepayment speeds, reported trades and broker-dealer quotes, all with reasonable levels of transparency. The pricing services did not apply any adjustments to the pricing models used. In addition, we did not apply any adjustments to prices received from the pricing services.\n\nWe reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques used by our pricing services at least annually. In addition, we corroborate the prices provided by our pricing services by comparing them to alternative pricing sources. In instances where price discrepancies are identified between different pricing sources, we evaluate such discrepancies to ensure that the prices used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment securities. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on investment securities.\n\nWithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are our holdings of debt securities issued by Community Development Financial Institutions. We take the carrying value for these investment securities to be a reasonable proxy for their fair value unless we determine, based on our internal credit model, that there are indicators that the contractual cash flows will not be received in full.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of our Level 2 derivative financial instruments is estimated by using third-party pricing models, where the inputs to those models are readily observable from active markets. The pricing models used are consistently applied and reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives as described below. We reaffirm our understanding of the valuation techniques at least annually and validate the valuation output on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the swap such as the notional amount, fixed coupon rate, floating coupon rate and tenor, as well as discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.\n\nThe fair value of foreign ex change forward contracts is determined based on a discounted cash flow method using the following significant inputs: the contractual terms of the forward contracts such as the notional amount, maturity dates and contract rate, as well as relevant foreign currency forward curves, and discount rates consistent with the underlying economic factors of the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.\n\nOur Level 3 derivative financial instrument represents an embedded derivative in the form of C Ordinary Shares of GBT JerseyCo Limited. The fair valuation is performed by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo Simulation technique that models a range of probable future stock prices using the following significant inputs: term of the earnout, initial stock price, annual ex pected volatility of the common stock over the ex pected term, annual risk-neutral rate of return over the contractual term and dividend yield, which is further reviewed by management.\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market parameters, such as a benchmark curve, used to value derivatives are not indicative of our credit quality or that of our counterparties. We consider the counterparty credit risk by applying an observable forecasted default rate to the current exposure. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on derivative financial instruments.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effectiv e, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market ev ents were to occur.\n\n## Credit\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and gov ernment entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can inv olv e JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses",

We have direct exposure to market risk. In addition, market risk may also impact our clients and markets in a manner that may indirectly impact us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market risk, see 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk-Market Risk.'\n\n## Our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global financial market and economic conditions and other factors.\n\nOur results  of  operations  have  been  in  the  past  and  may,  in  the  future,  be materially  affected  by  global  financial  market  and  economic  conditions, including, in particular, by periods of low or slowing economic growth in the United  States and other major markets, both directly and indirectly through their impact on client activity levels. These include the level and volatility of equity,  fix ed  income  and  commodity  prices;  the  level,  term  structure  and volatility of interest rates; inflation, currency values and unemployment rates; the  level  of  other  market  indices,  fiscal  or  monetary  policies  established  by governments, central banks and financial regulators; and uncertainty concerning  the  future  path  of  interest  rates,  government  shutdowns,  debt ceilings or funding, which may be driven by economic conditions, recessionary fears, market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and clients due to the effects of widespread events such as global pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related incidents, acts of war or aggression, geopolitical  instability,  changes  as  a  result  of  global  elections,  including changes in U.S. presidential administrations or Congress, changes to global trade policies, supply chain complications and the implementation of tariffs, protectionist  trade  policies,  trade  sanctions  or  investment  restrictions  and other factors, or a combination of these or other factors.\n\nThe  results  of  our  Institutional  Securities  business  segment,  particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products, are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty. These fluctuations impact results by causing variations in business flows and activity  and  in  the  fair  value  of  securities  and  other  financial  products. Fluctuations  also  occur  due  to  the  level  of  global  market  activity,  which, among other things, can  be  impacted  by  market  uncertainty  or  lack  of  investor  and  client confidence due to unforeseen economic, geopolitical or market conditions that in  turn  affect  the  size,  number  and  timing  of  investment  banking  client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments.\n\nPeriods of unfavorable market or economic conditions, including equity market levels and the level and pace of changes in interest rates and asset valuation, may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor confidence and participation in the global markets and/or the level of and mix of client assets, including deposits. This could also impact the level of net new asset flows and/or  flows  into  fee-based  assets. Any  of  these  factors  could  negatively impact the results of our Wealth Management business segment.\n\nSubstantial market fluctuations or divergence in asset performance could also cause  variations  in  the  value  of  our  investments  in  our  funds,  the  flow  of investment capital into or from AUM, and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed income or other investment alternatives, which  could  negatively  impact  the  results  of  our  Investment  Management business segment.\n\nThe value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the markets  may  make  it  difficult  to  value  and  monetize  certain  of  our  financial instruments, particularly during periods of market uncertainty or displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performance-based income (also  known  as  incentive  fees,  which  include  carried  interest)  in  respect  of certain  businesses.  In  addition,  at  the  time  of  any  sales  and  settlements  of these financial instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments, which may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid  depreciation  in  asset  values  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  asset liquidity. Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions, market participants are particularly ex posed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale, which could lead to increased individual counterparty risk for our businesses. Although our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk  to  more  ex treme  market  moves,  severe  market  events  have  historically been  difficult  to  predict,  and  we  could  realize  significant  losses  if  ex treme market events were to occur.",

The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred incom e tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the consolidated statem ents of incom e in the period that includes the enactm ent date.\n\nManagem ent periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred incom e tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable incom e in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If m anagem ent determ ines that it is not m ore likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the am ount expected to be recoverable in the future. T his allowance will result in additional incom e tax expense. F urther, the C om pany records its incom e taxes receivable and payable based upon its estim ated incom e tax position.\n\nEarnings per Share ('EPS') . Basic E P S is calculated by dividing net incom e applicable to com m on shareholders by the weighted-average num ber of shares outstanding during the period. D iluted E P S includes the determ inants of basic E P S and com m on stock equivalents outstanding during the period. D iluted E P S is com puted using the treasury stock m ethod.\n\nBusiness Segments . T he C om pany's m anagem ent directs BlackR ock's operations as one business, the asset m anagem ent business. T he C om pany utilizes a consolidated approach to assess perform ance and allocate resources. As such, the C om pany operates in one business segm ent.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nHierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The C om pany uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation approaches used to m easure fair value. T he fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active m arkets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities m easured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\n## Level 1 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active m arkets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.\n\n\u00b7 Level 1 assets m ay include listed m utual funds, E T F s, listed equities, com m odities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.\n\n## Level 2 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices for sim ilar assets or liabilities in active m arkets; quoted prices for identical or sim ilar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from  pricing services or brokers for which the C om pany can determ ine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as m odels or other valuation m ethodologies.\n\n\u00b7 Level 2 assets m ay include debt securities, loans held within consolidated C LO s, short-term  floating-rate notes, asset-backed securities, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts that have inputs to the valuations that generally can be corroborated by observable m arket data.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs:\n\nUnobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability, which m ay include nonbinding broker quotes. Level 3 assets include investm ents for which there is little, if any, m arket activity. T hese inputs require significant m anagem ent judgm ent or estim ation.\n\n\u00b7 Level 3 assets m ay include direct private equity investm ents, including those held within C IP s, investm ents in C LO s and loans held within consolidated C LO s and CIP s.\n\n\u00b7 Level 3 liabilities m ay include borrowings of consolidated C LO s and contingent liabilities related to acquisitions valued using the incom e approach based on unobservable m arket data, or other valuation techniques.\n\nSignificance of Inputs. The C om pany's assessm ent of the significance of a particular input to the fair value m easurem ent in its entirety requires judgm ent and considers factors specific to the financial instrum ent.\n\nValuation Approaches. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determ ined using various valuation approaches as appropriate, including third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and m arket and incom e approaches.\n\nA significant num ber of inputs used to value equity, debt securities, and loans held within C LO s and C IP s are sourced from  third-party pricing vendors. G enerally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active m arkets and as Level 2 for other sim ilar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determ ining the price.",

      "answer": "JPM reported $27 million in credit card loans under trial modifications during the year ended December 31, 2023, which are no longer classified as FDMs under the revised guidance from ASU 2022-02. This change eliminates the 'reasonably expected' and 'concession' criteria, shifting reporting to a rolling twelve-month performance basis for FDMs, as adopted by Capital One. Meanwhile, Schwab continues to reference nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings recorded prior to ASU 2022-02 adoption, indicating a transitional carryover in how certain loan modifications are disclosed, despite the new standard. This contrast highlights differing impacts on disclosure practices between institutions under the updated FDM framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 8 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nSeparate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives and the assets are carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise from any of our other businesses. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets. Separate accounts may also include deposits for funds held under stable value wrap funding agreements, although the majority of stable value wrap sales are measured based on the notional amount included in assets under management and do not include the receipt of funds. For additional information on separate accounts see Note 13 herein .\n\nOther liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities sold but not yet purchased, liabilities resulting from purchases of securities that had not yet settled, derivative liabilities, cash collateral received from derivative counterparties that contractually cannot be netted against derivative assets, allowance for credit losses in relation to off-balance sheet commitments, deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance agreements and liabilities classified as held-forsale.\n\nForeign currency: Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders' equity. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are remeasured into that entity's functional currency resulting in exchange gains or losses recorded in income. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income.\n\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) and net income (loss) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to AIG.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED DURING 2021 Income Tax\n\nOn December 18, 2019, the FASB issued an accounting standard that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendments also simplified other areas including the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted tax laws or rates and clarified the accounting for transactions that result in the step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard on its effective date of January 1, 2021. The impact of adoption was not material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Clarification of Accounting for Certain Equity Method Investments\n\nOn January 16, 2020, the FASB issued an accounting standard to clarify how a previously issued standard regarding a company's ability to measure the fair value of certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value should interact with equity method investments standards. The previously issued standard provides that such equity securities could be measured at cost, minus impairment, if any, unless an observable transaction for an identical or similar security occurs (measurement alternative). The new standard clarifies that a company should consider observable transactions that require the company to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with the equity method immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method.\n\nThe standard further clarifies that, when determining the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options a company should not consider, whether upon settlement or exercise, if the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option.\n\nWe adopted the standard prospectively on its effective date of January 1, 2021. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 193",

These  include  qualified  pension  plans,  postretirement  medical  plans  and  certain  retiree  life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries' qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company's insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally  comprised  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  fixed  maturity  securities  AFS,  equity  securities, derivatives, real estate and private equity investments. The assets backing the retiree life coverage also utilize insurance contracts issued by the Company's insurance affiliate and are held in a general account Life Insurance Funding Agreement.\n\nThe  insurance  contract  provider  engages  investment  management  firms  ('Managers')  to  serve  as  sub-advisors  for  the separate  accounts  based  on  the  specific  investment  needs  and  requests  identified  by  the  plan  fiduciary.  These  Managers  have portfolio  management  discretion  over  the  purchasing  and  selling  of  securities  and  other  investment  assets  pursuant  to  the respective investment management agreements and guidelines established for each insurance separate account. The assets of the qualified  pension  plans  and  postretirement  medical  plans  (the  'Invested  Plans')  are  well  diversified  across  multiple  asset categories and across a number of different Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations within any given asset category or with any of the given Managers.\n\nThe  Invested  Plans,  other  than  those  held  in  participant  directed  investment  accounts,  are  managed  in  accordance  with investment  policies  consistent  with  the  longer-term  nature  of  related  benefit  obligations  and  within  prudent  risk  parameters. Specifically,  investment  policies  are  oriented  toward  (i)  maximizing  the  Invested  Plan's  funded  status;  (ii)  minimizing  the volatility of the Invested Plan's funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of  return  in  excess  of  a  custom  benchmark  and  industry  standards  over  appropriate  reference  time  periods.  These  goals  are expected to be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan's investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically used to evaluate the investment risk of the Invested Plan's assets relative to liabilities,  analyze  the  economic  and  portfolio  impact  of  various  asset  allocations  and  management  strategies  and  recommend asset allocations.\n\nDerivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other financial variable that is otherwise restricted.",

The assets of the qualified  pension  plans  and  postretirement  medical  plans  (the  'Invested  Plans')  are  well  diversified  across  multiple  asset categories and across a number of different Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations within any given asset category or with any of the given Managers.\n\nThe  Invested  Plans,  other  than  those  held  in  participant  directed  investment  accounts,  are  managed  in  accordance  with investment  policies  consistent  with  the  longer-term  nature  of  related  benefit  obligations  and  within  prudent  risk  parameters. Specifically,  investment  policies  are  oriented  toward  (i)  maximizing  the  Invested  Plan's  funded  status;  (ii)  minimizing  the volatility of the Invested Plan's funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of  return  in  excess  of  a  custom  benchmark  and  industry  standards  over  appropriate  reference  time  periods.  These  goals  are expected to be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan's investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically used to evaluate the investment risk of the Invested Plan's assets relative to liabilities,  analyze  the  economic  and  portfolio  impact  of  various  asset  allocations  and  management  strategies  and  recommend asset allocations.\n\nDerivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other financial variable that is otherwise restricted.",

Our ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loan investments with dissimilar risk characteristics, such as collateral dependent loans, individually and on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in earnings within net investment gains (losses) in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loan investments that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loan investments being presented at the net amount expected to be collected.\n\nIn determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over contractual terms of mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or ex pected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See Notes 1 and 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL.\n\n## Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\n\nOur real estate investments are comprised of wholly-owned properties, and interests in both real estate joint ventures and real estate funds which invest in a wide variety of properties and property types, consisting of single and multi-property projects, and are broadly diversified across multiple property types and geographies.\n\nThe carrying value of our real estate investments was $13.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, or 2.9% of cash and invested assets, at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nOur real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio had appreciated to a $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion unrealized gain position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess our real estate investments for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the real estate may be impaired. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded impairment (loss) of $36 million and $2 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nWe diversify our real estate investments by property type, form of equity interest (wholly-owned, joint venture and funds) and geographic region to reduce risk of concentration. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our real estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned .\n\nProperty type diversification: Our real estate investments are categorized by property type as follows at:\n\n",

      "answer": "PYPL faces potential liquidity strain due to increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements, particularly in the context of unanticipated reductions in customer balances, which directly affects its ability to fund operations. In contrast, BLK manages its capital requirements through its subsidiary BTC, which is subject to specific regulatory capital metrics such as minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios. BTC proactively exceeds these capital adequacy thresholds, as of December 31, 2024, indicating a more buffered capital position.

Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets, liquidity needs due to unanticipated reductions in customer balances, or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position. Such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\n## If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed.\n\nOur reputation and brands are globally recognized, important to our business, and affect our ability to attract and retain our customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. We may experience scrutiny or criticism from customers, partners, employees, government entities, media, advocacy groups, and other influencers or stakeholders that disagree with, among other things, our product offering decisions, internal policies, or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may result from, among other things, new features, products, services, operational efforts, or terms of service (or changes to the same), or our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or information security. The proliferation of social media may increase and compound the likelihood, speed, magnitude, and unpredictability of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, our business and operating results may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\n\nOur key metrics are  calculated  using  internal  company  data  based  on  the  activity  we  measure  on  our  payments  platform  and  compiled  from  multiple  systems, including systems that are internally developed or acquired through business combinations. While the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require significant judgment. We regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve the accuracy or relevance of our metrics. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance. If investors, analysts, or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business, we may receive negative publicity, our reputation may be harmed, and our business may be adversely impacted.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance ('ESG') issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\n\nVarious jurisdictions are adopting or considering new laws and regulations that expand mandatory disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements with respect to ESG matters. If we are unable to comply with new laws and regulations concerning ESG  matters or fail to meet investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, we may be subject to fines, penalties, regulatory or other  enforcement  actions,  and  our  business  or  financial  condition  may  be  adversely  affected.  If  our  ESG -related  data,  processes  and  reporting  are  viewed  as incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to ESG -related goals on a timely basis or at all, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, investors, customers, partners, media, government entities, and other stakeholders (including those in support of or in opposition to ESG principles) may have a negative view of us to the extent we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to their ESG  concerns or take positions that are contrary to their views or ex pectations.\n\nWe recognize that climate-related risks may impact our business. For example, California, where our headquarters are located, has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, extreme weather and natural disaster events more frequently, including drought, flooding, heat waves, and wildfires. Such events may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n26",

Fair v alues determined internally  or v ia our third party  asset managers are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.\n\nThe methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed securities (RM BS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO), other asset -backed securities (A BS) and fixed maturity securities issued by government sponsored entities and corporate entities.\n\n## Equity Securities Traded in Active Markets\n\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure equity securities at fair value. M arket price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.\n\n## Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable\n\nWe estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower's creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.\n\n## Other Invested Assets\n\nWe initially  estimate the fair v alue of inv estments in certain hedge funds, priv ate equity  funds and other inv estment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, we generally obtain the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. We consider observable market data and perform certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially  determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments, other financing transactions of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate. AIG's retained investments in Corebridge, for which we have elected the fair value option, is determined using Corebridge's stock price as its fair value.\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nFor short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Shortterm investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\n\n## Freestanding Derivatives\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\n\nOTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. V aluation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\n\nFor certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. A ccordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\n112\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

      "question": "What is the total amortized cost of BAC's Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) holdings with maturities due after ten years, and how does this relate to AIG's exposure to commercial mortgage loans in terms of asset valuation practices?",
      "answer": "BAC reports that its amortized cost of Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) with maturities due after ten years is $1,688 million, yielding 2.61%. These CMBS holdings are primarily composed of securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans, as defined in the structured products section. AIG, in turn, directly holds commercial mortgage loans that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, particularly when impairment indicators arise. This implies that BAC's exposure to long-term commercial real estate risk is indirect through CMBS instruments, while AIG has a direct exposure through its commercial mortgage loan portfolio, both of which are subject to similar valuation and credit risk dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 CMBS: BAC discloses a $1,688 million amortized cost in Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) with a yield of 2.61% maturing after ten years, indicating a significant long-term exposure to commercial real estate risk through structured securities.",
        "Hop 2: CMBS \u2192 Commercial Mortgage Loans: CMBS are described as primarily comprising securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans, establishing a direct compositional and risk linkage between CMBS and the underlying commercial mortgage loans.",
        "Hop 3: Commercial Mortgage Loans \u2190 AIG: AIG holds commercial mortgage loans that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, particularly during impairment assessments, indicating a direct and active management of valuation risk in the same asset class underlying CMBS."

These underlying securities are critical to financing activities and are marked-to-market when the fair value option is elected. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley holds insurance contracts in non-U.S.-based plans that are valued based on the insurer's premium reserve and categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These insurance contracts are tied to the fair value of underlying securities, which are unobservable and determined using pricing models or discounted cash flow methodologies. Both firms rely on the fair value of underlying securities, but differ in asset class (debt securities vs. insurance contracts) and valuation transparency (observable vs. unobservable inputs).",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 Underlying Securities: JPM holds high-quality government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs as collateral in resale and repurchase agreements, with exposure to credit and liquidity risk managed through collateral monitoring and margin calls.",
        "Hop 2: Underlying Securities \u2192 Insurance Contracts: Insurance contracts held by firms like Morgan Stanley are valued based on unobservable market values of their underlying securities, which are determined using pricing models or discounted cash flows.",
        "Hop 3: Insurance Contracts \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley categorizes these insurance contracts in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and values them based on the insurer's premium reserve, which approximates fair value and is tied to the performance of the underlying securities."

In addition, as a Global Systemically Important Bank ('GSIB'), JPMorganChase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer ('SCB'), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorganChase is required to hold in order to satisfy these lev erage- and risk-based requirements could increase at any giv en time due to factors such as:\n\n- actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules and regulations",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of MS's asset management revenues to fixed income market fluctuations compare with PYPL's exposure to market risk through its use of pricing models for derivatives and debt securities?",
      "answer": "MS's asset management revenues are sensitive to changes in fixed income markets due to their reliance on fee-based client assets, which include fixed income investments valued using pricing models with observable market data like interest rates and credit spreads. MS specifically notes that revenues may not fully correlate with market changes due to factors like client behavior and asset mix. Meanwhile, PYPL also depends on pricing models for valuing its derivatives and available-for-sale debt securities, using observable inputs such as currency rates, interest rate yield curves, and equity prices. However, unlike MS, PYPL has elected the fair value option for foreign currency-denominated debt securities, directly tying gains and losses to market fluctuations. Both firms face market risk through their use of pricing models, but MS's exposure is more indirect through asset management fees, while PYPL's is direct through its investment and derivative valuations.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments,  as  well  as  through  funds  that  invest  in  these  assets.  These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk  related  to  these  investments  is  measured  by  estimating  the  potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10% decline in  investment  values  and  related  impact  on  performance-based  income,  as applicable.  Investment  sensitivity  changed  between  December  31,  2024  and December  31,  2023  primarily  due  to  new  investments  in  the  Community Reinvestment  Act  affordable  housing  and  new  private  credit  funds  in Investment Management.\n\n## Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity\n\nCertain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management  and Investment  Management  business  segments  are  derived  from  management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in  Investment  Management  (together,  'client  holdings').  The  assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. These revenues depend on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry  mix  of  client  assets,  and  client  behavior  such  as  the  rate  and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may not correlate completely with changes in the related markets.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to  credit  risk  from  institutions  and  individuals  through  our  Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nWe incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- extending credit to clients through loans and lending commitments;\n- entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties may have obligations to make payments to us;\n- acting as clearing broker for listed and over-the-counter derivatives whereby we guarantee client performance to clearinghouses;\n- providing  short-  or  long-term  funding  that  is  secured  by  physical  or financial collateral, including, but not limited to, real estate and marketable securities,  whose  value  may  at  times  be  insufficient  to  fully  cover  the repayment amount;\n- posting  margin  and/or  collateral  to  clearinghouses,  clearing  agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties;\n- placing  funds  on  deposit  at  other  financial  institutions  to  support  our clearing and settlement obligations; and\n- investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets  may  fluctuate  based  on  realized  or  expected  defaults  on  the underlying obligations or loans.\n\nWe incur credit risk in our Wealth Management business segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- margin loans collateralized by securities;\n- securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending to ultra-high net worth clients, that are in most cases secured by various types of collateral, including marketable securities, private investments, commercial real estate and other financial assets;\n- single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming, non-conforming or HELOC form, primarily to existing Wealth Management clients; and\n- employee  loans  granted  primarily  to  recruit  certain  Wealth  Management representatives.\n\n## Monitoring and Control\n\nThe  Credit  Risk  Management  Department  ('CRM')  establishes  Firmwide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels.  The  CRM approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis, and helps  ensure  that  credit  ex posure  is  actively  monitored  and  managed.  The evaluation  of  counterparties  and  borrowers  includes  an  assessment  of  the probability  that  an  obligor  will  default  on  its  financial  obligations  and  any losses  that  may  occur  when  an  obligor  defaults.  In  addition,  credit  risk exposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the  CRM and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals  from  the  CRM.  A  comprehensive  and  global  Credit  Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.\n\nCertain  fix ed  income  funds  are  recorded  using  the  NAV   practical  ex pedient.  The  NAV   valuations  are  based  on  the  underlying  investments  and  typically redeemable within 90 days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding.\n\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n\n## Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments\n\nThe required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules.

Accordingly, we have valued the asset and liability using quoted prices on the active exchange that we have identified as the principal market for the underlying crypto assets (Level 2).

      "answer": "AIG benefits from being supervised at the worldwide group level only by its U.S. insurance regulators under Covered Agreements authorized by Title V of the Dodd-Frank Act, which exempts it from EU Solvency II group capital, reporting, and governance requirements. This streamlined global regulatory oversight likely reduces compliance burdens and enhances operational flexibility for AIG. In contrast, MET is subject to U.S. federal regulation, including Dodd-Frank, but primarily regulated at the state level, where laws and new regulatory standards\u2014such as those impacting statutory reserve and capital requirements\u2014can vary and introduce complexity. MET must also adapt to evolving state-level capital requirements and new reserving standards for life insurance products, which could constrain its flexibility compared to AIG\u2019s more centralized regulatory framework. This regulatory distinction under the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementation through Covered Agreements contributes to differing compliance strategies and competitive positioning between the two insurers.",

      "answer": "The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act, imposes obligations on financial institutions to monitor and report suspicious transactions. V discloses in its 2024 10-K that it is subject to anti-money laundering regulations including the BSA and must prohibit entities in OFAC-sanctioned jurisdictions from issuing or acquiring Visa cards. Meanwhile, MS\u2019s 2024 10-K states that under the BSA (as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act), it must implement anti-money laundering (AML) programs, verify customer identities, and monitor and report suspicious activity. The USA PATRIOT Act\u2019s expansion of BSA requirements directly shapes both companies\u2019 obligations, with V focusing on transactional prohibitions tied to sanctioned jurisdictions and MS emphasizing internal AML program development and suspicious activity reporting.",

T hese include a wide range  of  players,  such  as  technology  companies,  information  serv ices  and  consulting  firms,  gov ernments  and  merchant  serv ices  companies.  T he integration of technology like generativ e AI can create new and better offerings that compete with our v alue-added serv ices, such as strengthened risk monitorization and managing digital identification. Regulatory initiativ es could also lead to increased competition in these areas.\n\nWe  believ e  our  fundamental  v alue  proposition  of  security,  conv enience,  speed  and  reliability  as  well  as  the  number  of  credentials  and  our acceptance footprint help us to succeed.  In addition, we understand the needs of the indiv idual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, gov ernments, NGOs and business organizations to prov ide tailored and innov ativ e solutions. We will continue to utilize our network of networks strategy to facilitate the mov ement of money. We believ e Visa is well-positioned competitiv ely due to our global brand, our  broad  set  of  payment  products,  new  flows  offerings  and  v alue-added  serv ices  and  our  prov en  track  record  of  processing  payment  transactions securely and reliably.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nAs a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the v arious jurisdictions in which our products and serv ices are used. The most significant gov ernment regulations that impact our business are discussed below . For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A -Regulatory Risks .\n\nAnti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign gov ernment officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business adv antage. We are also subject to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensiv e OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea and the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic regions of Ukraine), or that are included on OFAC's list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, to issue or acquire Visa cards or engage in transactions using our products and serv ices.\n\nGovernment-imposed Market Participation Restrictions: Certain  gov ernments,  including  China,  India,  Indonesia,  T hailand  and  Vietnam,  hav e taken actions to promote domestic payments systems and/or certain issuers, payments networks or processors, by imposing regulations that fav or domestic prov iders, impose local ownership requirements on processors, require data localization or mandate that domestic processing be done in that country.\n\nInterchange  Rates  and  Fees: An  increasing  number  of  jurisdictions  around  the  world  regulate  or  influence  debit  and  credit  interchange reimbursement rates in their regions. For example, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Act (Dodd-Frank Act) limits interchange reimbursement rates for certain debit card transactions in the U.S.; the European Union (EU) IFR limits interchange rates in the European Economic Area (EEA) (as discussed below); and the Reserv e Bank of Australia (RBA) regulates av erage permissible lev els of interchange.\n\nInternet Transactions: Many jurisdictions hav e adopted regulations that require payments system participants to monitor, identify, filter, restrict or take other actions with regard to certain types of payment transactions on the Internet, such as gambling, digital currencies, the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol and other controv ersial transaction types.\n\nNetwork Exclusivity and Routing: In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act limits network exclusiv ity and restrictions on merchant routing choice for the debit and prepaid market segments. Other jurisdictions impose similar limitations, such as the IFR's prohibition in Europe on restrictions that prev ent multiple payment brands or functionality on the same card.\n\nNo-surcharge  Rules: We have historically enforced rules that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using Visa products instead of other means. Howev er, merchants' ability to surcharge v aries by geographic market as well as Visa product type, and continues to be impacted by litigation, regulation and legislation.",

          "chunk_text": "The E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment firm regimes, including  rules  regulating  compensation  for  certain  persons  providing services to certain investment funds.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations\n\nThe  U.S.  Bank  Secrecy  Act,  as  amended  (BSA),  including  by  the  USA PATRIOT  Act  of  2001  and  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  of  2020 (AMLA), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates  the  promulgation  of various regulations applicable  to  financial  institutions,  including  standards  for  verifying  client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions  and  report  suspicious  activities.  Through  these  and  other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may  be involved in terrorism,  money laundering or other suspicious activities.\n\nThe AMLA was intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money  laundering  laws.  Among  other  things,  the  AMLA  codifies  a risk-based  approach  to  anti-money  laundering  compliance  for  financial institutions;  requires  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  to  periodically promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA  compliance;  expands enforcementand investigation-related authority,  including  a  significant  expansion  in  the  available  sanctions  for certain  BSA  violations;  and  expands  BSA  whistleblower  incentives  and protections. Certain statutory provisions in the AMLA require rulemakings beyond those that have already been finalized, reports and other measures. The  impact  of  the  AMLA  will  depend  on,  among  other  things,  these additional rulemakings and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network  (FinCEN),  a  bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of Treasury, has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering  the  financing  of  terrorism,  as  required  under  the AMLA.  The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking organization activity, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\n24 Goldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nThe  Corporate  Transparency Act (CTA) was enacted in 2021 as part of the  AMLA  and  designed  to  establish  beneficial  ownership  information reporting requirements for certain types of entities, and in 2024, FinCEN's rule implementing the reporting requirements of the CTA  became effective. Under the rule, domestic companies formed before 2024 would be  required  to  file  their  initial  report  by  January  1,  2025  and  domestic companies  formed  in  or  after  2024  would  be  required  to  file  their  initial report within, respectively, 90 or 30 days of their formation, in each case subject to certain exemptions. On February 19, 2025, FinCEN announced that the earliest initial reporting deadline is March 21, 2025.\n\nIn 2024, FinCEN and the SEC proposed a rule that would require certain investment  advisers  to  implement  reasonable  procedures  to  identify  and verify  the  identities  of  their  customers.  In  2024,  FinCEN  proposed  to amend  the  anti-money  laundering/countering  the  financing  of  terrorism (AML/CFT) program requirements for all financial  institutions  subject  to the  BSA  that  have  AML/CFT  program  obligations,  including  us.  The proposal  would,  among  other  things,  require  a  financial  institution's  risk assessment  process  to  identify,  evaluate  and  document  the  financial institution's  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  illicit  activity risks, and update such risk assessments on a periodic basis. In 2024, the U.S.  federal  bank  regulatory  agencies  proposed  amendments  to  their respective  BSA  program  rules  to  align  those  rules  with  the  FinCEN proposal.  FinCEN has also adopted a rule, effective on  January 1, 2026, that  includes  certain  investment  advisers,  such  as  us,  in  the  definition  of 'financial  institutions'  under  FinCEN's  rules  implementing  the  BSA  and, among other things, prescribes minimum standards for  AML/CFT programs to be established by such investment advisers and requires them to report suspicious activity to FinCEN.\n\nWe are  subject  to  other  laws  and  regulations  worldwide  relating  to  antimoney  laundering  and  financial  transparency,  including  the  E.U.  AntiMoney  Laundering  Directives.  In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  the  U.K.  Bribery  Act  and  other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing  anything  of  value,  for  the  benefit  of  government  officials  and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification  of  clients,  monitoring  for  and  reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.",

Federal consumer protection laws to which we  are  subject  include  the  G ramm-Leach-Bliley  Act's  privacy  provisions, Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act,  Home  Mortgage  Disclosure  Act,  Electronic Fund  Transfer  Act, Fair Credit Reporting  Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, all of which are  enforced by the  CFPB.  We are also subject to certain federal consumer protection  laws  enforced  by  the  OCC,  including  the  Servicemembers  Civil Relief Act. Furthermore, we are subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials  are  empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a range of our activities.\n\n## Non-U.S. Regulation\n\nOur  businesses  are  regulated  ex tensively  by  non-U.S.  regulators,  including governments,  central  banks  and  regulatory  bodies,  securities  exchanges, commodity exchanges, and self-regulatory organizations, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. Certain regulators  have prudential, business conduct and other authority over us or our subsidiaries, as well as powers to limit or restrict us from engaging in certain businesses or to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censures, fines, asset seizures  and  forfeitures,  the  issuance  of  cease-and-desist  orders,  or  the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity, its affiliates or its employees. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential requirements that are applicable under non-U.S. law.\n\n## Firmwide Financial Crimes Program\n\nOur Financial Crimes program  is coordinated  and  implemented  on  an enterprise-wide  basis  and  supports  our  financial  crime  prevention  efforts across  all  regions  and  business  units.  The  program  includes  anti-money laundering  ('AML'),  economic  sanctions  ('Sanctions'),  anti-boycott,  anticorruption, anti-tax evasion, and government and political activities compliance programs and aligned business-line risk functions.\n\nIn the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001  and  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  of  2020,  imposes  significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and mutual funds to develop and implement  AML  programs,  verify  the  identity  of  customers  that  maintain accounts, and\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\nmonitor  and  report  suspicious  activity  to  appropriate  law  enforcement  or regulatory authorities. Outside  of the U.S., applicable laws, rules  and regulations  similarly  require  designated  types  of  financial  institutions  to implement AML programs.\n\nWe are also subject to Sanctions, such as regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. government, including the U.S. Treasury Department's  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  U.S. Department  of  State,  and  similar  sanctions  programs  imposed  by  foreign governments or global or regional multilateral organizations. In addition, we are subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering,  promising,  giving  or  authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.\n\n## Cyber and Information Security Risk Management and Protection of Client Information\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  faces  increased  global  regulatory  focus regarding  cyber  and  information  security  risk  management  practices.  Many aspects of our businesses are subject to cybersecurity legal, regulatory and disclosure requirements enacted by U.S. federal and state governments and other  non-U.S.  jurisdictions.  These  requirements  are  generally  aimed  at codifying basic cybersecurity protections and mandating data breach notification requirements.\n\nOur  businesses  are  also  subject  to  increasing  privacy  and  data  protection legal  requirements  concerning  the  use  and  protection  of  certain  personal information with regard to clients, employees and others. These requirements impose mandatory privacy and data protection obligations, including providing  for  individual  rights,  enhanced  governance  and  accountability requirements,  and  significant  fines  and  litigation  risk  for  noncompliance.  In addition, several jurisdictions have enacted or proposed personal and other data  localization  requirements  and  restrictions  on  cross-border  transfer  of personal and other data that may restrict our ability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional financial and regulatory burdens to do so.\n\nNumerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and regulations in these areas and  many  are  considering  new  or  updated  ones  that  could  impact  our businesses, particularly as the application, interpretation and enforcement of these  laws,  rules  and  regulations  are  often  uncertain  and  evolving.  Many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer and other information, as well as the privacy and cybersecurity laws referenced above. We have adopted measures designed  to  comply  with  these  and  related  applicable  requirements  in  all relevant jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "At V, Class A common stockholders have full voting rights on all matters, while preferred stockholders (Series A, B, and C) have limited voting rights only in specific scenarios such as mergers or amendments to the certificate of incorporation. In contrast, MA's Class A shares carry one vote per share, with 3,000 million authorized shares, and its preferred shares have no issued or outstanding shares as of December 31, 2023, with voting rights to be determined upon issuance. This indicates that V\u2019s Class A common stockholders have broader and more active voting influence compared to MA, where the preferred shares have not been issued and therefore do not constrain the voting dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "GS&amp;Co. is our principal U.S. broker-dealer and is registered as a brokerdealer, a security-based swap dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District  of  Columbia.  U.S.  self-regulatory  organizations,  such  as FINRA  and  the  NYSE,  have  adopted  rules  that  apply  to  broker-dealers, such as GS&amp;Co.\n\nOur  principal  subsidiaries  operating  in  Europe  include:  Goldman  Sachs International (GSI),  Goldman  Sachs  International  Bank (GSIB),  Goldman Sachs  Asset  Management  International  (GSAMI),  Goldman  Sachs  Bank Europe SE (GSBE), Goldman Sachs  Asset Management B.V .,  and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC).\n\nOur  E.U.  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  various  E.U.  regulations,  as  well  as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSBE is directly  supervised  by  the  European  Central  B ank  (ECB )  and  additionally by  BaFin  and  Deutsche  Bundesbank  in  the  context  of  the  E.U.  Single Supervisory  Mechanism.  GSBE  engages  in  certain  activities  primarily  in the  E.U.,  including  underwriting  and  market  making  in  debt  and  equity securities  and  derivatives,  investment,  asset  and  wealth  management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial  advisory  services.  GSBE  is  also  registered  with  the  CFTC  as  a swap dealer and with the  SEC as a security-based swap dealer and as a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. Like our other foreign bank subsidiaries, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB's Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting  and  market  making  in  equity  securities  based  on  GSBE's and/or GS Bank USA's capital.\n\nGSPIC is an investment firm under the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and the French Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC's activities include certain  activities  that  GSBE  is  prevented  from undertaking. GSPIC is subject to the E.U. Investment Firm Regulation, the prudential regime for E.U. investment firms.\n\nGSI is a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB is a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As a designated investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements similar to those applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements.  GSI  provides  broker-dealer  services  in  and  from  the  U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending)  and  deposit-taking  activities  (including  by  taking  retail  deposits) and  is  a  primary  dealer  for  U.K.  government  bonds.  GSI  and  GSIB maintain  branches  outside  of  the  U.K.  and  are  subject  to  the  laws  and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located.\n\nOur  principal  subsidiary  operating  in Asia  is  Goldman  Sachs  Japan  Co., Ltd.  (GSJCL).  GSJCL is our regulated  Japanese broker-dealer subsidiary and is  regulated  by  Japan's  Financial  Services Agency,  the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\n\n## Banking Supervision and Regulation\n\nThe  Basel  Committee  is  the  primary  global  standard  setter  for  prudential bank regulation. However,  the Basel Committee's  standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules  to  implement  its  standards.  The  implications  of  B asel  Committee standards  and  related  regulations  for  our  businesses  depend  to  a  large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\n\nCapital  and  Liquidity  Requirements. We  and  GS  Bank  USA  are subject to risk-based regulatory capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB  (Capital Framework).  The  Capital  Framework  is  largely  based  on  the Basel Committee's framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management  of  banks  (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies'  tailoring  framework,  we  and  GS  Bank  USA  are  subject  to 'Category  I'  standards  because  we  have  been  designated  as  a  global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are 'Advanced approach' banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements  that  involve  quantitative  measures  of  assets,  liabilities  and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\n\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements  Directive,  as  amended  (CRD),  which  are  largely  based  on Basel III.\n\nGSI  and  GSIB  are  subject  to  the  U.K.  capital  and  liquidity  frameworks prescribed  in  the  PRA  Rulebook  and  the  U.K.  Capital  Requirements Regulation,  which  are  also  largely  based  on  B asel  III  and  are  generally aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks.",

      "answer": "PYPL relies on third-party custodian partners to hold customer cryptocurrency assets and has selected them based on regulatory oversight, capital requirements, audit certifications, and cybersecurity procedures. However, PYPL explicitly discloses the risk that bankruptcy courts have not definitively determined the treatment of digital assets held by custodians, potentially treating them as part of the custodian\u2019s estate and delaying or precluding return to customers. In contrast, SCHW directly manages its cybersecurity risks through internal and external teams, security tools, and formal processes to identify, assess, and remediate threats, stating that while prior cybersecurity events have not been material, they continue to face increasing risks. This highlights PYPL's indirect exposure through custodians versus SCHW's direct operational control and mitigation strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 5 - Derivative instruments\n\nDeriv ativ e contracts deriv e their v alue from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without hav ing to initially inv est in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorganChase makes markets in deriv ativ es for clients and also uses deriv ativ es to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm's deriv ativ es are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes.\n\n## Market-making derivatives\n\nThe majority of the Firm's deriv ativ es are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use deriv ativ es to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm activ ely manages the risks from its exposure to these deriv ativ es by entering into other deriv ativ e contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client deriv ativ es.\n\n## Risk management derivatives\n\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using deriv ativ e instruments, including deriv ativ es in hedge accounting relationships and other deriv ativ es that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate deriv ativ es to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market v alue as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixedrate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the deriv ativ e instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this v ariability.\n\nForeign currency deriv ativ es are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm's net inv estments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar-equiv alent v alues of the foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted rev enues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the deriv ativ e instruments related to these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this v ariability.\n\nCommodities deriv ativ es are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inv entories. Gains or losses on these deriv ativ e instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inv entory.\n\nCredit deriv ativ es are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit deriv ativ es compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit ev ent, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit deriv ativ es primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit deriv ativ es section on pages 222-224 of this Note for a further discussion of credit deriv ativ es.\n\nRefer to the risk management deriv ativ es gains and losses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 218-221 of this Note for more information about risk management deriv ativ es.\n\n## Derivative counterparties and settlement types\n\nThe Firm enters into OTC deriv ativ es, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the deriv ativ e counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared deriv ativ e contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm's counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared deriv ativ es are traded on a bilateral basis and then nov ated to the CCP for clearing.\n\n## Derivative clearing services\n\nThe Firm prov ides clearing serv ices for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients' deriv ativ e contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm's clearing serv ices.\n\n## Accounting for derivatives\n\nAll free-standing deriv ativ es that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair v alue.\n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets deriv ativ e assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receiv ables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the deriv ativ e counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in v alue of a deriv ativ e depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Deriv ativ es that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair v alue through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 213-221 of this Note prov ide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, deriv ativ e assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of deriv ativ es embedded in structured notes.",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's valuation approach for insurance contracts in its non-U.S. pension plans compare to JPMorgan's management of market risk in securities financing agreements, given both institutions rely on the fair value of underlying securities for financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley values its non-U.S. pension plan insurance contracts based on the insurer's premium reserve, categorizing them in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which depends on unobservable market values of the underlying securities. These securities are typically priced using discounted cash flow methodologies. JPMorgan, on the other hand, actively manages market risk in its securities financing activities by requiring high-quality collateral\u2014primarily government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and agency MBS\u2014and continuously monitoring margin levels. Both firms rely on the fair value of underlying securities for financial reporting, but Morgan Stanley\u2019s approach is more indirect through insurance contracts, while JPMorgan directly holds and actively manages these securities as part of its financing operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Insurance Contracts: MS discloses that its non-U.S. pension plans hold insurance contracts valued based on the insurer's premium reserve, which approximates fair value and is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",
        "Hop 2: Insurance Contracts \u2192 Underlying Securities: These insurance contracts invest in underlying securities whose values are unobservable and determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.",

Similarly, V references the Dodd-Frank Act as a source of competitive pressure due to government-backed payment systems that could disintermediate its network, such as RTP initiatives or mandates favoring domestic networks over international ones.

      "question": "How does MetLife's exposure to derivatives governed by ISDA Master Agreements under the Orderly Liquidation Authority compare to Bank of America's resolution planning risks, given both companies' regulatory obligations under Dodd-Frank?",
      "answer": "MetLife manages credit risk in its derivatives transactions through ISDA Master Agreements that allow for close-out netting, which is subject to financial regulations such as the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) under Dodd-Frank. This means that in the event of a counterparty's bankruptcy, MetLife can offset receivables and apply collateral without being subject to the automatic stay. Similarly, Bank of America Corporation is required to submit resolution plans to the FDIC and Federal Reserve that outline a 'single point of entry' strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or potentially the OLA. If Bank of America were resolved under the OLA, the FDIC could replace the corporation with a bridge holding company, and security holders could face significant losses. Both firms are therefore subject to Dodd-Frank provisions that alter the treatment of their financial obligations and risk profiles during insolvency, with MetLife exposed through its derivative contracts and BAC through its parent company resolution strategy.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Dodd-Frank: MetLife is subject to Dodd-Frank, which governs the use of derivatives and allows for close-out netting under ISDA Master Agreements, particularly under the Orderly Liquidation Authority.",
        "Hop 2: Dodd-Frank \u2192 Orderly Liquidation Authority: Dodd-Frank includes the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which permits the FDIC to manage the liquidation of systemically important financial institutions outside of traditional bankruptcy proceedings.",
        "Hop 3: Orderly Liquidation Authority \u2190 BAC: Bank of America is subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority and must submit resolution plans to the FDIC and Federal Reserve, which could result in significant losses for its security holders if the FDIC invokes the OLA."

Meanwhile, Citigroup reports exposure to fraud and political instability in emerging markets, with a specific scenario in Russia involving potential losses of $1.6 billion in CTA (Cumulative Translation Adjustment) and $0.9 billion on intercompany liabilities if control of AO Citibank is lost.

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adv erse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external ev ents impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activ ities and can manifest itself in v arious ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary ev ents beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behav ior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of v endors or other third party prov iders to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate lev els in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory env ironments in which it operates.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ('CCOR') Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to gov ern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO') and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite and are independent of the respectiv e businesses or functions they ov ersee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Gov ernance and Ov ersight Policy that is rev iewed and approv ed by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\n\n## Operational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiv eness of their respectiv e control environment to assess circumstances in which controls hav e failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance')\n\nprov ides ov ersight of and challenge to these ev aluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk ev ents and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes ev aluating the effectiv eness of the control env ironments and reporting the results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitativ e means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach ('LDA') statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency and sev erity of operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss ov er a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence lev el. T he LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses ev en after the issues or business activ ities giv ing rise to the losses hav e been remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational risk capital methodology, which uses the Adv anced Measurement Approach ('AMA'), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and ev aluation of key business env ironment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and dev elops a forward looking v iew of material operational risk ev ents that may occur in a stressed env ironment. The Firm's operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97-107 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\n## Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with",

Moreover, Citi may need to record additional reserves for expected losses for its credit ex posures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law (see 'Managing Global Risk-Other RisksCountry Risk-Argentina' and '-Russia' and 'Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates' below).\n\nIn the event of a loss of control of AO Citibank in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off its remaining nominal net investment, (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.9 billion on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside of Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. For additional information about these risks and related potential impacts, see the operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk factors above and 'Managing Global Risk-Other Risks-Country Risk-Russia' below.\n\nIn addition, political turmoil and instability; geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts (including those related to China, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflicts in the Middle East); terrorism; and other instabilities have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe, which impact Citi's businesses, results of operations and financial conditions in those countries where Citi operates and have required, and may continue to require, management time and attention and other resources, such as managing the impact of sanctions and their effect on Citi's operations in certain emerging market countries.

      "answer": "Wells Fargo received regulatory approval on June 21, 2024, for its Dodd-Frank resolution plan, indicating its strategy to maintain equity and unsecured debt\u2014such as through its Support Agreement transferring significant assets to its intermediate holding company\u2014is currently deemed sufficient for orderly resolution. In contrast, Capital One has not yet faced finalized Dodd-Frank 'source of strength' rules, which the Federal Banking Agencies are required to jointly adopt under the Act. While both are subject to Dodd-Frank resolvability requirements, Wells Fargo has operational clarity and regulatory validation of its capital structure, whereas Capital One remains in a regulatory limbo, with uncertain timing and content of future rules that could impose similar obligations, such as maintaining minimum long-term debt of at least 6% of total risk-weighted assets under the proposed LTD framework.",

          "chunk_text": "referred to as total loss absorbing capacity, for purposes of resolvability and resiliency.\n\nFrom time to time, federal banking regulators propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB closely monitors capital levels of the institutions it supervises and may require such institutions to modify capital lev els based on FRB determinations. Such determinations, proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.\n\nAs an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the FDI A ct requires federal banking regulators to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they  are the primary  federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, executive compensation and risk management. Federal banking regulators are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.\n\nThe FDI Act requires federal banking regulators to take 'prompt corrective action' with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A depository institution's treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital lev els compare to various capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.\n\nIn addition, the FRB's capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. Federal banking regulators also require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.\n\nFor additional information on our capital requirements and planning, as well as the leverage and liquidity rules applicable to us, see the 'Capital Management' and 'Risk M anagement - Asset/Liability M anagement Liquidity Risk and Funding - Liquidity Standards' sections in the 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders.\n\n## 'Living Will' Requirements and Related Matters\n\nLiving Will . Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 'living wills,' designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly  resolution in the ev ent of material financial distress or failure. Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a reorganization or liquidation of a covered company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. In addition to the Company's resolution plan, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the 'Bank') is also required to prepare and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and FDIC determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or operations. On June 21, 2024, the FRB and FDIC announced that the Company's most recent resolution plan did not have any shortcomings or deficiencies.\n\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the 'orderly liquidation authority.' The orderly liquidation authority allows for the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically important financial institution that is in default or in danger of default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC's orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors' claims.\n\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only material legal entity  to enter resolution proceedings. However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly liquidation authority , but not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\n\nTo facilitate the orderly  resolution of sy stemically  important financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly resolution.\n\nSupport Agreement . In response to the regulators' guidance and to facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the 'Support Agreement'), with WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the 'IHC'), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (WFS), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (WFCS), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes (the 'Covered Entities') or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan (the 'Related Support Entities'). Pursuant to the Support A greement, the Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time to time.

Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution.

The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard.

For additional information, see 'Regulatory Capital Buffers' and 'Prompt Corrective Action Framework' below.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the 'capital floor provision' of the Dodd-Frank Act (the so-called 'Collins Amendment'), which requires banking organizations to calculate 'generally applicable' capital requirements. As a result, Citi must calculate each of the three riskbased capital ratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital) under both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the more binding of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.\n\n## Leverage Ratio\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, Citigroup is also required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 4.0%. Similarly, Citibank is required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 5.0% to be considered 'well capitalized' under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Leverage ratio, a non-riskbased measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n## Supplementary Leverage Ratio\n\nCiti is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR), which differs from the Leverage ratio by including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The SLR represents end-of-period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure. Total Leverage Exposure is defined as the sum of (i) the daily average of onbalance sheet assets for the quarter and (ii) the average of certain off-balance sheet ex posures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum SLR of 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including Citigroup, are subject to a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the 3.0% stated minimum SLR requirement, resulting in a 5.0% SLR. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed this requirement, it will be subject to increasingly stringent restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) on capital distributions and discretionary ex ecutive bonus payments.\n\nSimilarly, Citibank is required to maintain a minimum SLR of 6.0% to be considered 'well capitalized' under the Prompt Corrective Action framework.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Treatment-Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that modified the regulatory capital transition provision related to the current ex pected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The rule does not have any impact on U.S. GAAP accounting.\n\nThe rule permitted banks to delay for two years the 'Day One' adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology on January 1, 2020 until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition to phase out the regulatory capital benefit provided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing impact of CECL, the agencies utilized a 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increased reserve build under CECL compared to the previous incurred loss model and, therefore, allowed banks to add back to CET1 Capital an amount equal to 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the cumulative 25% change in CECL-based allowances between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 started to be phased in to regulatory capital (i) at 25% per year on January 1 of each year over the three-year transition period and (ii) along with the delayed Day One impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected the modified CECL transition provision provided by the rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and were fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citigroup's reported Standardized Approach CET1 Capital ratio of 13.6% benefited from the deferrals of the CECL transition provision by 8 basis points. For additional information on Citigroup's and Citibank's regulatory capital ratios ex cluding the impact of the CECL transition provision, see 'Capital Resources (Full Adoption of CECL)' below.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Buffers\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to maintain several regulatory capital buffers above the stated minimum capital requirements. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nBanking organizations that fall below their regulatory capital buffers are subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on a percentage of 'Eligible Retained Income' (ERI), with increasing restrictions based on the severity of the breach. ERI is equal to the greater of (i) the bank's net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of the bank's net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi's regulatory capital ratios ex ceeded the regulatory capital requirements.

T he  Company has entered into a litigation management deed with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory cov ered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory cov ered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conv ersion or reduction in the conv ersion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). T he litigation management deed provides  that  the  Company  will  generally  control  the  conduct  of  the  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  subject  to  certain  obligations  to  report  and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory cov ered litigation (VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee). The VE T erritory Litigation  Management Committee, which is composed of representativ es of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory cov ered litigation.\n\nThe  Company  obtained  certain  protections  for  VE  territory  cov ered  losses  through  the  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  the  UK  loss  sharing agreement and the litigation management deed (collectiv ely Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan). T he plan cov ers VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates, where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. T he plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law  enforcement  proceedings,  only  the  interchange  litigation  specifically  cov ered  by  the  plan's terms.\n\nUnlike the U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan, the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan does not hav e an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recov er VE territory cov ered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection av ailable through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan is equiv alent to the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conv ersion rate applicable to each series of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the v alue of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The book v alue of the preferred stock reflects its historical v alue recorded at the Closing less VE territory cov ered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conv ersion rate. T he book v alue does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory cov ered losses as long as the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory cov ered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders' equity in the contra-equity account right to recov er for cov ered losses, which represents the Company's right to recov er such losses through adjustments to the conv ersion rate applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nVE territory cov ered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conv ersion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, indiv idual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conv ersion rate is made, the amount prev iously recorded in right to recov er for cov ered losses is then recorded against the book v alue of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2024, the eighth anniv ersary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee, carried out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $2.7 billion of the as-conv erted v alue from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024 (Eighth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock receiv ed a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment div ided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically conv erted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.",

      "question": "How does MetLife's implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework differ from American Express's in terms of governance structure and strategic focus on threat detection and response capabilities?",
      "answer": "MetLife's Information Security Program is governed by a centralized structure led by the enterprise Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC), the Audit Committee, and the Board. The Program emphasizes a threat-centric and risk-based approach, focusing on monitoring, reporting, managing, and remediating cyber threats to prevent data exfiltration, manipulation, and system disruption. In contrast, American Express's program is built on advanced security technology, a well-staffed expert team, and operations based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's five pillars: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. AXP places particular strategic emphasis on continuous investment in cyber security capabilities and participation in industry and government forums to advance the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem, indicating a more outward-facing and collaborative approach to threat detection and response.",

        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Information Security Program: MetLife's program is led by the CISO, who oversees a threat-centric, risk-based approach to cyber risk management with direct reporting lines to senior governance bodies.",

        "Hop 3: NIST Cybersecurity Framework \u2190 AXP: American Express's cyber security program is also founded on the NIST framework, but with an emphasis on advanced technology, expert staffing, and industry collaboration to enhance detection and response capabilities."

TD Ameritrade, as a broker-dealer, must comply with the Uniform Net Capital Rule, requiring it to maintain sufficient net capital to ensure financial soundness. Since Schwab has integrated TD Ameritrade into its operations and includes its capital management under broader CSC consolidated measures, any limitations on external capital inflows from entities like BlackRock could impact TD Ameritrade\u2019s ability to meet or exceed regulatory capital thresholds without internal capital reallocation or additional Schwab investment.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n- Expense management products and services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n\nOur various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. We have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). The commercial arrangements with GBT include, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBT uses the American Express brand, GBT's support of certain of our partnerships, joint negotiation with travel suppliers and a strategic relationship between GBT and our GCS business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT was reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT's acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights remain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG). Upon consummation of the business combination, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by APSG's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals, the terms of certain of our commercial arrangements with GBT will be amended and GBT will become a public company.\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., domestic or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for 'non-swiped' card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, service fees earned from merchants, travel commissions and fees, and Membership Rewards program fees; and\n- Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with our GNS partners (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, earnings (losses) from equity method investments (including GBT), insurance premiums, and prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue.",

Derivatives\n\n## Accounting for Derivatives\n\nSee Note 1 for a description of the Company's accounting policies for derivatives and Note 13 for information about the fair value hierarchy for derivatives.\n\n## Derivative Strategies\n\nThe Company is exposed to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ('OTC') market. Certain of the Company's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ('OTC-cleared'), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ('OTC-bilateral').  The types of derivatives the  Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash markets.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nInterest rate total return swaps are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and a benchmark interest rate, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. Interest rate total return swaps are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). The Company utilizes interest rate total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company purchases interest rate caps primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, and interest rate floors primarily to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

The  fair  value  adjustments  from  de-designated  AFS  debt securities hedges decreased the AFS debt securities carrying value by $4.4 billion and $5.6 billion at December 3 1, 202 4 and 2023. The fair value adjustments are being amortized or accreted into interest over the contractual lives of the assets or liabilities.\n\n## Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\n\nThe following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 202 4, 2023 and 2022. Of the $5.6 billion after-tax net loss ($7.5 billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 3 1, 202 4, losses of $2.5 billion after-tax ($3.4 billion pretax) related to both open and closed cash  flow  hedges  are  expected  to  be  reclassified  into  earnings  in  the  next  12 months.  These  net  losses  reclassified  into  earnings  are  expected  to  primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items.  For  open  cash  flow  hedges,  the  maximum  length  of  time  over  which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately five years. For terminated cash flow  hedges,  the  time  period  over  which  the  forecasted  transactions  will  be recognized  in  interest  income  is  approximately four  years,  with  the  aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant.\n\nOn  November  15,  2023,  Bloomberg  Index  Services  Limited  announced  the permanent cessation of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) and all its tenors effective after final publication on November 15, 202 4. The Corporation determined  that  certain  forecasted  BSBY -indexed  interest  payments,  which  had been designated in cash flow hedges, were no longer expected to  occur  beyond November 15, 202 4 as they would transition to a new reference rate. Accordingly , during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $ 2.0 billion of pretax loss  from  accumulated  OCI  into  market  making  and  similar  activities  for  the amount related to these forecasted transactions.",

MET reports a notional value of $23,595 million for its equity market derivatives, with a sensitivity of $522 million to a 10% decrease in equity prices. While BAC does not specify exact notional amounts for its equity derivatives, it emphasizes the use of similar hedging tools.

      "answer": "BlackRock faces increased operational complexity and compliance costs due to Dodd-Frank-mandated central clearing of certain swaps transactions, which requires new compliance monitoring procedures and increases the cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for its clients. Morgan Stanley, as a financial holding company, is subject to Basel III-based capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios that impact its capital adequacy planning and require phased-in adjustments for CECL accounting impacts starting at 50% in 2023. These differences reflect BlackRock\u2019s focus on compliance with derivatives execution and margin rules, while Morgan Stanley must maintain specific capital buffers and manage regulatory capital calculations under Federal Reserve oversight.",

        "Hop 1: BLK \u2192 Central Clearing Requirements: BlackRock must implement new compliance monitoring procedures due to Dodd-Frank requirements for central clearing of certain swaps transactions, increasing operational complexity and trading costs for non-cleared derivatives.",
        "Hop 2: Central Clearing Requirements \u2192 Dodd-Frank Act: The Dodd-Frank Act imposes central clearing and trading venue execution requirements for certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, with potential future expansion to other products.",
        "Hop 3: Dodd-Frank Act \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley is subject to Basel III-based capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios, with CECL deferral impacts phased in at 50% starting in 2023."

      "answer": "AIG utilizes pricing models as part of its insurance risk management framework to estimate losses and expenses, which directly informs underwriting decisions and premium adequacy. These models are subject to internal controls and oversight to ensure they reflect actual risk exposure. On the other hand, Capital One employs Level 3 Valuation techniques, which rely on significant unobservable assumptions in the absence of active market data, using pricing models and discounted cash flow (DCF) methodologies to value assets or liabilities. Both companies rely on complex modeling, but AIG's models are grounded in insurance risk estimation, while Capital One's Level 3 valuations depend more heavily on internal assumptions not corroborated by observable market inputs.",

          "chunk_text": "AIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by A IG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several A IG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\n\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with A IG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. A IG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal A udit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\n\n## INSURANCE RISKS\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\n\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A  primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\n\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability  and reserv e rev iews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.\n\nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. For further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves.\n\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.\n\nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\n\nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.\n\nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability  or unwillingness to pay , contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\n\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n\n85",

      "answer": "The UK's implementation of central clearing requirements for derivatives is increasing operational complexity and costs for both BlackRock and JPMorgan. BlackRock is required to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures, particularly for its funds and accounts that engage in non-cleared derivatives trading, which subjects them to initial and variation margin requirements. Similarly, JPMorgan, which operates in the UK, faces heightened supervisory standards and must align its risk governance framework to meet local regulatory expectations. Both firms are adapting to these rules, which are likely to result in increased capital outlays and administrative burdens.",

      "answer": "Schwab's minimum total risk-based capital ratio requirement is 10.5%, which incorporates both a 2.5% stress capital buffer and a 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the base regulatory minimum. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase's minimum total risk-based capital ratio is also 10.5%, but this only includes a 2.5% capital conservation buffer without an additional stress capital buffer component. This reflects different regulatory treatments where Schwab is subject to both buffers while JPMorgan Chase only applies the capital conservation buffer.",

For BAC, this buffer combines with a 2.5% G-SIB surcharge, resulting in a total buffer requirement of 5.0% above the minimum risk-based capital ratio. Similarly, MS also computes its capital buffer as the sum of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and the 2.5% G-SIB surcharge, leading to an identical total buffer requirement of 5.0% above the minimum risk-based capital ratio.

      "answer": "Capital One expects to reclassify an after-tax loss of $624 million from AOCI to earnings over the next 12 months related to forecasted transactions hedged by derivatives. Like Capital One, MetLife uses foreign exchange option and forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure, specifically to hedge forecasted transactions and protect against earnings and cash flow fluctuations due to exchange rate changes. However, MetLife\u2019s hedging policy specifies a maximum horizon of four years, while Capital One has forecasted transactions hedged for up to 9.2 years.",

Derivatives\n\n## Accounting for Derivatives\n\nSee Note 1 for a description of the Company's accounting policies for derivatives and Note 13 for information about the fair value hierarchy for derivatives.\n\n## Derivative Strategies\n\nThe Company is exposed to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ('OTC') market. Certain of the Company's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties ('OTC-cleared'), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties ('OTC-bilateral').  The types of derivatives the  Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash markets.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nThe Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nInterest rate total return swaps are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and a benchmark interest rate, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. Interest rate total return swaps are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). The Company utilizes interest rate total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\nThe Company purchases interest rate caps primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, and interest rate floors primarily to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n\n## MetLife, Inc.\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fix ed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest ex pense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at September 28, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nThe Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.\n\nThe Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\n\nThe Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company's net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $9.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $99 million. The following table summarizes the effect of foreign ex change cash flow hedges on AOCI:\n\n",

The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately 9.2 years as of December 31, 2024.

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of Visa's Class B-2 common stock conversion rate to follow-on offerings compare to the conversion rate adjustments for Class B-1 shares, and how does this differential sensitivity potentially affect voting power dynamics given the dual-class stock structures observed in peer companies?",
      "answer": "Visa's Class B-2 common stock conversion rate adjustments have double the impact compared to adjustments for Class B-1 shares, as stated explicitly in Visa's 2023 10-K filing. This differential sensitivity means that future follow-on offerings of Class A common stock (or cash deposits in lieu thereof) will disproportionately affect Class B-2 holders relative to Class B-1 holders regarding their eventual conversion into Class A shares. In the context of peer companies like Comcast, where dual-class structures allocate non-dilutable voting power (e.g., Class B shares have 15 votes per share), such differential conversion mechanics could amplify voting power concentration among remaining Class B holders over time. This dynamic is particularly relevant given that Mastercard also maintains a dual-class structure with non-publicly traded Class B shares, suggesting industry-wide strategic use of multi-tiered equity frameworks to manage control.",

      "answer": "At BAC, if dividends on certain preferred stock series are in arrears for three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly periods, holders gain voting rights to elect two additional directors, which terminate once dividends are paid for at least two semi-annual or four quarterly periods following the arrearage. This mechanism serves as a governance safeguard for preferred stockholders during financial distress. In contrast, V\u2019s Class C common stockholders have no general voting rights except in specific defined matters, such as exiting the core payments business or certain corporate restructurings, and they do not participate in amendments solely affecting preferred stock. Unlike BAC\u2019s contingent voting rights tied to dividend performance, V\u2019s Class C stockholders\u2019 voting power is structurally limited and not directly linked to financial performance metrics like dividend arrears.",

The number of votes that each share of Class A common stock has at any given time depends on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, with each share of Class  B  common stock having 15 votes per share.  The  Class  B common stock represents 33 /3% of the combined voting power of our common stock, which percentage is generally non-dilutable under the terms of our articles of incorporation. Mr. Brian L. Roberts beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Generally, including as to the election of directors, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote as one class except where class voting is required by law. 2 1\n\n## Div idends\n\nWe expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

      "answer": "BAC applies a Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5% under the Standardized approach as of December 31, 2023, while SCHW's subsidiary CSB maintains a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%. Both institutions benefit from the Federal Reserve's current setting of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at zero, which reduces their overall capital requirements. However, BAC's capital strategy incorporates a G-SIB surcharge of 2.5% alongside its buffer requirements, whereas SCHW structures its capital to meet minimum ratios of 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5% for Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and Total Risk-Based Capital respectively, inclusive of buffers.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Countercyclical Capital Buffer: BAC notes that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer was zero for both reporting periods, and applies a Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5% at December 31, 2023 under the Standardized approach.",
        "Hop 2: Countercyclical Capital Buffer \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: The Federal Reserve sets the Countercyclical Capital Buffer at zero, while the Capital Conservation Buffer is a fixed requirement of 2.5% that applies across advanced and standardized regulatory approaches.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley reports a $338M net counterparty exposure in the UK, indicating direct credit risk tied to counterparties in that jurisdiction. In contrast, BlackRock has no economic interest in BlackRock Life Limited's pension assets but earns investment advisory fees for managing them. These assets are legally segregated and not available to BlackRock\u2019s creditors, meaning BlackRock\u2019s exposure is indirect and fee-based rather than asset-backed. This contrast reveals that Morgan Stanley bears direct credit risk in the UK market, while BlackRock\u2019s risk is limited to operational and reputational exposure tied to its advisory services.",

      "question": "How might the SEC's Regulation Best Interest, which requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers, influence Goldman Sachs' compliance costs and competitive positioning against Morgan Stanley, given their differing approaches to consumer protection regulations and retail client expansion?",
      "answer": "Goldman Sachs faces increased compliance costs due to consumer protection regulations like Regulation Best Interest, which applies to its consumer-oriented activities, including transaction banking and retail client services. The MET_10k_2024.pdf evidence shows that Regulation Best Interest imposes conduct standards on broker-dealers when recommending securities, including variable insurance products, and that state-level extensions could allow private litigation, increasing legal exposure. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's 2024 10-K acknowledges intense competition in the U.S. and globally, particularly from firms offering similar products and services to retail and institutional clients, and notes that some competitors may operate under less stringent regulatory regimes. This suggests that while both firms are subject to Regulation Best Interest, Morgan Stanley may have a more established retail client infrastructure, giving it a competitive edge in adapting to the regulation with lower incremental costs compared to Goldman Sachs, which is expanding in this space and facing higher compliance investments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Regulation Best Interest: Goldman Sachs is subject to Regulation Best Interest in its consumer-oriented activities, including transaction banking and retail client services, which increases compliance, legal, and operational risk.",

        "Hop 3: Broker-Dealers \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley competes with other broker-dealers and notes in its 10-K that some competitors may be subject to less stringent regulatory regimes, potentially giving them a competitive advantage in adapting to new rules like Regulation Best Interest."

Continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the  U.S.,  China or other countries taking other actions,  which  could  include  the  implementation  of  sanctions,  tariffs  or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or restrictions on cross-border trade, investment or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients' businesses, as well as our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\n\nA  conflict,  or  concerns  about  a  potential  conflict,  involving  China  and Taiwan,  the  U.S.  or  other  countries  could  negatively  impact  financial markets and our or our clients' businesses. Trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries in response to a conflict or potential conflict involving China,  including  financial  and  economic  sanctions  and  export  controls against  certain  organizations  or  individuals,  or  actions  taken  by  China  in response to trade restrictions, could negatively impact our or our clients' ability to conduct business in certain countries or with certain counterparties  and  could  negatively  impact  regional  and  global  financial markets  and  economic  conditions. Any  of  the  foregoing  could  adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\n\n## We face enhanced risks as we operate in new locations and transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties.\n\nOur  businesses,  have  in  the  past,  and  may  in  the  future,  bring  us  into contact,  directly  or  indirectly,  with  individuals  and  entities  that  are  not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example,  we  continue  to  transact  business  and  invest  in  new  regions, including  a  wide  range  of  emerging  and  growth  markets,  and  we  expect this  trend  to  continue.  V arious  emerging  and  growth  market  countries have  experienced  severe  economic  and  financial  disruptions,  including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on  sovereign  debt,  capital  and  currency  exchange  controls,  and  low  or negative  growth  rates  in  their  economies.  The  possible  effects  of  any  of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses  and increased volatility in financial markets generally.\n\nIn  our  consumer-oriented  activities,  we  have  faced  and  continue  to  face compliance,  legal  and  regulatory  risk,  increased  reputational  risk  and increased  operational  risk  due  to,  among  other  things,  higher  transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer  and  client  information.  We  are  also  subject  to  additional  legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for  example,  Regulation  Best  Interest,  fair  lending  laws  and  regulations and  privacy  laws  and  regulations).  Further,  identity  fraud  may  increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.\n\nIn connection with our transaction banking activities, we face compliance, legal  and  regulatory  risk,  including  with  respect  to  know-your-customer, anti-money  laundering  and  reporting  requirements  and  prohibitions  on transfers of property  belonging  to countries, entities and  individuals subject  to  sanctions  by  U.S.  or  other  governmental  authorities.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Standards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\n\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the 'DOL'), the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\nThe prohibited transaction rules of  ERISA and the  Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to  ERISA plans and participants and to  Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\n\nIn  2021,  the  DOL 's  final  version  of  the  prohibited  transaction  ex emption  ('PTE')  2020-02  went  into  effect,  which  allows  investment  advice  fiduciaries  to  receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of 'fiduciary' for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of 'fiduciary' and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors.\n\nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products.\n\nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms 'advisor' or 'adviser' without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\n\nIn  January  2025,  the  Chilean  Congress  approved  a  major  pension  reform  bill,  which  improves  pensions  by  increasing  employer  contributions,  correcting  certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile's Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.",

While  we  believe  this information is the best available at the time, we may only be able to complete limited  validation.  Furthermore,  modeling  capabilities  and  methodologies  to analyze climate-related risks, although improving, remain nascent and emerging  and  are  subject  to  uncertainty  due  to  limited  historical  trend information and the absence of standardized and comprehensive data. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially, which could impact our ability to manage climate-related risks.\n\n## Competitive E nvironment\n\nWe face strong competition from financial services firms and others, which could lead to pricing pressures that could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\nThe financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete with commercial banks, global investment banks, regional banks, broker-dealers, wire houses, private  banks,  registered  investment  advisers,  digital  investing  platforms, traditional  and  alternative  asset  managers,  financial  technology  firms  and other  companies  offering  financial  and  ancillary  services  in  the  U.S.  and globally.  We compete on the basis of several factors, including transaction execution,  capital  or  access  to  capital,  products  and  services,  innovation, technology, reputation, risk appetite and price.\n\nWe  have  experienced,  and  will  likely  continue  to  experience,  increased competition in the U.S. and globally driven by established financial services firms  and  emerging  firms,  including  non-financial  companies  and  business models focusing on technology innovation, competing for the same clients and assets, or offering similar products and services to retail and institutional customers. It is also possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial or other institutions that may be, or will become, larger, or better capitalized, or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products.\n\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices and fees, paying higher interest rates on deposits, eliminating commissions or other fees or otherwise providing more favorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent, legal and regulatory regimes than we are, thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. For more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see 'BusinessCompetition' and 'Business-Supervision and Regulation.'\n\n## Automated trading markets and the introduction and application of new technologies may adversely affect our business and may increase competition.\n\nWe continue to experience price competition in some of our businesses. In particular,  the  ability  to  ex ecute  securities,  derivatives  and  other  financial instrument trades electronically  on  ex changes,  swap  ex ecution  facilities  and other  automated  trading  platforms,  and  the  introduction  and  application  of new  technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, will likely continue  the  pressure  on  revenues.  The  trend  toward  direct  access  to automated, electronic markets will likely continue as additional markets move to  more  automated  trading  platforms.  We  have  ex perienced,  and  will  likely continue to experience, competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future.\n\nOur  ability  to  retain  and  attract  qualified  employees  is  critical  to  the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\n\nOur  people  are  our  most  important  asset.  We  compete  with  various  other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. If we are unable to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly qualified employees or successfully transition key roles, or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. Our ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  and  skilled  personnel  depends  on numerous factors, some of which are outside of our control.\n\nCompensation costs required to attract and retain employees may increase or the competitive market for talent may further intensify due to factors such as low unemployment, a strong job market and changes in employees' expectations, concerns and preferences. The financial industry has experienced,  and  may  continue  to  experience,  more  stringent  regulation  of employee compensation than other industries, which may or may not impact competitors. These more stringent regulations have shaped our compensation practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees.\n\n## International Risk\n\nWe are  subject  to  numerous  political,  economic,  legal,  tax,  operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our international operations that could adversely impact our businesses in many ways.\n\nWe  are  subject  to  numerous  political,  economic,  legal,  tax,  operational, franchise  and  other  risks  that  are  inherent  in  operating  in  many  countries, including risks of possible nationalization, ex propriation, price controls, capital controls,  ex change  controls,  increased  tax es  and  levies,  cybersecurity,  data transfer and outsourcing restrictions, regulatory scrutiny regarding the use of new technologies, prohibitions on certain",

      "answer": "JPMorgan addresses transition risk through its Firmwide Climate Risk Framework, which includes setting policies, developing metrics and stress testing mechanisms, and establishing a climate risk data strategy to assess financial impacts. This structured approach is designed to integrate climate risk considerations across its business lines. In contrast, Bank of America identifies reputational risk as a potential consequence of failing to meet its climate-related commitments, such as its $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal, which includes $1 trillion dedicated to supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. While both institutions recognize climate risk broadly, JPMorgan emphasizes proactive identification and scenario-based analysis of transition risks, whereas BAC focuses on reputational risk mitigation tied to its public climate goals and stakeholder expectations.",

      "answer": "American Express has a significant financial exposure to the Lending Trust, with $2,100 million in long-term debt maturing in 2026. This exposure is tied to the performance of securitized Card Member loans and receivables, and any triggering events related to underperformance could lead to early amortization of the Trust's debt securities. Meanwhile, MetLife evaluates potential triggering events on an ongoing basis that could affect the fair value of its reporting units and potentially impair goodwill. While American Express had no triggering events in 2023, MetLife acknowledges that deteriorating economic or market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments. Both companies are sensitive to asset performance stability, but American Express faces direct financial liability tied to specific debt maturities, whereas MetLife's risk is more qualitative and tied to broader economic conditions.",

      "question": "How does Citi's governance structure for managing operational risk, which could lead to reputational impact, compare to Mastercard's disclosed approach for addressing similar reputational risks in their business operations?",
      "answer": "Citi manages operational risk through a robust governance framework that includes a three-line defense model, with Internal Audit providing independent assurance to the Board and Audit Committee over the effectiveness of risk management and controls. This includes oversight of enterprise support functions that address operational risk, compliance risk, and reputation risk. According to Citi\u2019s 10-K, the Audit Committee is specifically responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of Citigroup's control environment and the timely remediation of significant compliance or operational control breaks, which directly ties to mitigating reputational impact. On the other hand, Mastercard discloses in its 10-K that reputational risk is managed under the category of 'Brand, Reputational Impact and Environmental, Social and Governance' within its business and operations framework. While Citi emphasizes structural oversight and independent assurance to prevent operational failures from escalating into reputational harm, Mastercard integrates reputational risk management more broadly within its brand and ESG strategies, suggesting a different organizational approach to similar risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit\n\nInternal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit and reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit Committee and administratively to Citi's CEO. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and issues identified through Internal Audit's activities.\n\n## Enterprise Support Functions\n\nEnterprise support functions engage in activities that support safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in maintaining an effective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions are composed of Human Resources and Global Legal Affairs and Compliance (exclusive of ICRM, which is part of the second line of defense). Front line units may also include enterprise support units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the Controllers Group within Finance).\n\nEnterprise support functions, units and activities are subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).\n\n## Risk Governance\n\nCiti's ERM Framework encompasses risk management processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi's commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk management practices.\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi's risk appetite.\n\n## Executive Management Team\n\nThe Citigroup CEO directs and oversees the day-to-day management of Citi as delegated by the Board of Directors. The CEO leads the Company through the Executive Management Team and provides oversight of group activities, both directly and through authority delegated to committees established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure continued alignment with Citi's risk strategy.\n\n## Board and Executive Management Committees\n\nThe Board executes its responsibilities either directly or through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its oversight and risk management responsibilities:\n\n- Audit Committee : assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to (i) the integrity of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements, financial reporting process and systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (ii) the performance of the internal audit function (Internal Audit), (iii) the annual independent integrated audit of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of Citigroup's internal control over financial reporting, the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Auditors) and the evaluation of the Independent Auditors' qualifications, independence and performance, (iv) holding management accountable for the effectiveness of Citigroup's control environment and status of corrective actions, including the timely remediation of control breaks (including, without limitation, significant compliance or operational control breaks), (v) policy standards and guidelines for risk assessment and risk management, (vi) Citigroup's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures and (vii) the fulfillment of the other responsibilities set out in the Audit Committee's Charter.\n- Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee : is responsible for overseeing compensation of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and Citi management's sustained focus on fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible conduct and accountability within the organization. The Committee regularly reviews Citi's management resources and the performance of senior management. The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and approving the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and members of Citi's Ex ecutive Management Team. The Committee is also responsible for approving the incentive compensation structure for other members of senior management and certain highly compensated employees (including discretionary incentive awards to covered employees as defined in applicable bank regulatory guidance), in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee from time to time. The Committee also has broad oversight over compliance with bank regulatory guidance governing Citi's incentive compensation.\n- Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee : is responsible for (i) identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending to the Board the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board's performance, (iii) recommending to the Board directors for each committee for appointment by the Board, (iv) reviewing the Company's policies and programs that relate to public issues of significance to the",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase's evaluation of voting rights in its consolidation policy affect its accounting treatment of investments in entities that issue non-voting perpetual preferred stock like Series C, given that such instruments are disclosed by another firm (V) as convertible participating preferred stock?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase evaluates voting rights as a key factor in determining whether it consolidates an entity, requiring majority voting equity interests or equivalent contractual control for consolidation. This applies to investments where voting rights enable significant decision-making. However, Series C Preferred Stock, as described in the second evidence chunk, is non-voting perpetual preferred stock, which would not confer such decision-making power. Firm V, in turn, classifies Series C Preferred Stock as convertible participating preferred stock with a book value of $540 million as of September 30, 2024, indicating it holds economic participation rights but not voting rights. Therefore, under JPM\u2019s consolidation policy, an investment in such non-voting preferred stock would not trigger consolidation but might be accounted for under the equity method or at fair value, depending on the level of influence JPM holds.",

          "chunk_text": "## Note 1 - Basis of presentation\n\nJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ('JPMorganChase' or the 'Firm'), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial serv ices firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in inv estment banking, financial serv ices for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further discussion of the Firm's reportable business segments.\n\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated.\n\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first ev aluating whether the entity is a v oting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\n\n## Voting interest entities\n\nVoting interest entities are entities that hav e sufficient equity and prov ide the equity inv estors v oting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations. For these types of entities, the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of v oting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities' v oting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that giv e the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\n\nInv estments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence ov er operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the v oting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair v alue if the fair v alue option was elected. T hese inv estments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest rev enue.\n\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the\n\nJP M organ C hase &amp; C o./2024 F orm  10-K\n\ngeneral partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remov e the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority v ote, or the non-affiliated partners or members hav e rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these v oting interest entities. Howev er, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not hav e substantiv e kick-out or participating rights, the Firm ev aluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest.\n\nThe Firm's inv estment companies and asset management funds hav e inv estments in both publicly-held and priv ately-held entities, including inv estments in buyouts, growth equity and v enture opportunities. These inv estments are accounted for under inv estment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespectiv e of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair v alue, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest rev enue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized inv estment company guidelines.\n\n## Variable interest entities\n\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activ ities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) hav e equity inv estors that do not hav e the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through v oting rights, or do not hav e the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not hav e the right to receiv e the residual returns of the entity.\n\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to inv estors. The basic SPE structure inv olv es a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to inv estors. The legal documents that gov ern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE's inv estors and other parties that hav e rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate inv estors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE.

Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. direct deposits insured by the FDIC to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs.\n\nIn August, 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require covered bank holding companies such as American Express Company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external long-term debt and certain insured depository institutions such as AENB to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible internal long-term debt. See 'Supervision and Regulation - Capital and Liquidity Regulation' under 'Business' for more information.\n\n## DEPOSIT PROGRAMS\n\nWe offer deposits within our U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB. These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category through the FDIC; as of December 31, 2024, approximately 92 percent of these deposits were insured. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. The direct deposit program offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, certificates of deposit (CDs), business checking and consumer rewards checking account products available directly to customers. As of December 31, 2024, our direct deposit program had approximately 3.3 million accounts. AENB also sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. CDs carry stated maturities while high-yield savings account, checking account and third-party sweep deposit products do not. We manage the duration of our maturing obligations, including CDs, to reduce concentration and refinancing risk.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $139.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\n\nThe following table sets forth the average interest rates we paid on different types of deposits during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Changes in the average interest rate we paid on our deposits were primarily due to the impact of higher market interest rates offered for retail deposits.\n\n## TABLE 20: AVERAGE INTEREST RATES PAID ON DEPOSITS\n\n",

The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness.\n\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB's capital levels. The FDIA's brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\n\n## The value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\n\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $1.2 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Defaults, threats of defaults or economic disruptions, even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure, conduct business or have operations, could adversely affect us. \u2122",

      "question": "How does the credit event risk associated with MS's investments in CLNs, which embed credit protection sold to issuers, compare to BAC's use of credit derivatives to mitigate commercial credit exposure, particularly in terms of how each firm manages counterparty risk through derivative instruments?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley (MS) invests in CLNs and CDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. If there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm, indicating a direct exposure to counterparty risk. This contrasts with Bank of America (BAC), which actively purchases credit protection to cover both funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures as part of its commercial credit risk management strategy. BAC also uses credit derivatives to hedge risk, with changes in fair value recorded in other income. Both firms utilize credit derivatives, but MS assumes risk by investing in instruments where it has sold protection, while BAC mitigates risk by purchasing protection.",

Switzerland implemented sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on financial transactions and services. Bank of America's net exposure to Switzerland in 2023 was $9.229 billion, a decrease of $1.459 billion from 2022, which may reflect adjustments in response to geopolitical risks, including the impact of sanctions on financial flows and risk management strategies.",

      "answer": "AIG holds $1,812 million in U.S. government securities as part of its U.S. Plan Assets, which are primarily used to support retirement and employee benefit plans, as disclosed in PEP_10k_2023.pdf. These assets are managed with a focus on capital preservation and stable returns. In contrast, BAC's exposure to government securities is part of its broader market-making and trading activities within Global Markets, which involve managing risk across a wide range of financial products, including government securities. BAC's use of government securities is dynamic and tied to trading strategies, client services, and risk management, as described in BAC_10k_2023.pdf. The distinct purposes\u2014long-term liability matching for AIG versus short-term trading and liquidity provision for BAC\u2014result in different risk and liquidity profiles despite both institutions holding government securities.",

Schwab (SCHW) is also subject to the same CCyB, which was zero as of December 31, 2023, and must maintain a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. Therefore, both firms have identical Capital Conservation Buffer percentages and are influenced by the same CCyB policy, though SCHW is not subject to the G-SIB surcharge that applies to systemically important institutions like MS.",

      "answer": "The expiration of CSC's $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit line in January 2025 removes a committed source of liquidity that was available to meet short-term funding needs. This contrasts with Goldman Sachs' reliance on $22.4 billion in unsecured short-term borrowings from third-party banks as of December 2024, which remains a significant component of its short-term funding strategy. Both firms depend on external banks for liquidity, but GS maintains a more substantial and ongoing unsecured borrowing relationship with third-party banks, while CSC's expired facility was not renewed, signaling a shift toward alternative liquidity sources or tighter cash management.",

During the first quarter of 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our banking subsidiaries had access to funding through the Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). This program offered loans through March 11, 2024 of up to one year in length, and amounts available were dependent upon the par value of certain investment securities pledged as collateral. This facility was not used in 2024 or 2023, and as of December 31, 2024, there was no collateral pledged under the BTFP.

      "answer": "Under Basel III, the PCA Framework thresholds were updated to require higher capital ratios for banks to be classified as well-capitalized. For COF, as a Category III institution, it must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and total capital ratio of 8.0%. However, to be considered well-capitalized under PCA, COF must meet higher thresholds: a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more, and total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more. Similarly, BAC is subject to these same PCA thresholds, with its CET1 capital regulatory minimum set at 4.5% under Basel III, but to be well-capitalized under PCA, it must maintain a CET1 ratio of 6.5% or more, reflecting the updated PCA requirements. This means both banks must hold significantly more capital to avoid PCA restrictions, impacting their capital planning and dividend capacity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Basel III Capital Rules: COF, as a Category III institution, must maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and total capital ratio of 8.0% under Basel III.",
        "Hop 2: Basel III Capital Rules \u2192 PCA Framework: Basel III updated the PCA Framework, raising the capital thresholds for banks to be classified as well-capitalized to a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more, and total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more.",
        "Hop 3: PCA Framework \u2190 BAC: BAC is subject to the same PCA thresholds and must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% to be classified as well-capitalized, despite its regulatory minimum CET1 ratio being 4.5% under Basel III."

Capital One now prospectively reports on FDMs, including modifications like principal forgiveness and interest rate reductions.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers.\n\nGovernment regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in the markets we operate, which are subject to interpretation and change.\n\nPayments regulation. Various  laws  and  regulations  govern  the  payments  industry  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally.  In  the  U.S.,  PayPal,  Inc.  (a  wholly-owned subsidiary) holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in the states where such licenses are required, as well as in the District of Columbia and certain territories. These licenses include not only our PayPal-branded products and services, but also our V enmo, Hyperwallet, Xoom, and Zettle products and services, to the ex tent offered in these locations. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to, among other requirements, restrictions on the investment of customer funds, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In certain cases, these licenses also generally cover PayPal's service enabling customers to buy, hold, transfer, and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal or V enmo account. In the State of New Y ork, PayPal holds a full Bitlicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state.\n\nOutside the U.S., we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries. The activities of those nonU.S.  entities  are,  or  may  be,  supervised  by  a  financial  regulatory  authority  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. Among  other  regulatory  authorities,  the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the 'CSSF'), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the People's Bank of China, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Central Bank of Brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions. This list is not ex haustive, and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have asserted or may assert jurisdiction over our activities.\n\nIn  addition,  financial  services  regulators  in  various  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  ('EU'),  have  implemented  payment  authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud, which could impose significant costs, make it more difficult for new customers to open PayPal accounts, and reduce the ease of use of our products.\n\nFinancial Services supervision . We serve our customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.\u00e0.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. ('PayPal (Europe)'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in Lux embourg by the CSSF. We serve our customers in the U.K. through PayPal U.K. Limited ('PayPal U.K.'), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is subject to regulation as an electronic money institution in the U.K. by the FCA. Accordingly, we must comply with rules and regulations applicable to electronic money institutions in the U.K. and credit institutions in the E.U., including those related to capitalization, funds management, corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering,  consumer  rights,  disclosure,  reporting,  and  inspection.  We  are,  or  may  be,  subject  to  financial  services-related regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial services industry. In addition, based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions, we are, or may be, subject to indirect regulation and ex amination by the regulators of these partner financial institutions.\n\nLending regulation .  Our  U.S.  consumer  short-term,  interest-free,  installment  product  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  laws  governing  consumer  credit  and  debt collection, and PayPal holds multiple state licenses as the lender for this product. In Australia, PayPal Credit Pty Limited offers a consumer short-term, interest-free, installment product that is exempt from regulation by the primary consumer credit legislation, but is subject to other laws which cover the provision of financial services, credit reporting, debt collection, and privacy. PayPal's consumer short-term, interest-free, installment products in the U.K., France, G ermany, Spain, and Italy are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation; however, certain consumer lending laws, consumer protection, and banking transparency regulations apply to this activity.  Paidy,  Inc.  holds  multiple  licenses  for  the  issuance  of  its  consumer  installment  products  in  Japan  and  is  registered  with  the  Ministry  of Economy, Trade and Industry as a Comprehensive Credit Purchase Intermediary.\n\n10",

      "question": "Given SCHW's credit risk exposure in securities lending and MET's reported $10,510 million in securities lending fair value with a $245 million year-over-year decline, how might the shrinking reinvestment portfolio at MET impact SCHW's collateral management strategy and potential credit loss provisions?",
      "answer": "SCHW faces credit risk in its securities lending activities due to potential client defaults and collateral inadequacy, especially during periods of market volatility. MET's securities lending fair value declined from $11,756 million in 2022 to $10,510 million in 2023, representing a $1,246 million decrease, with a corresponding drop in its reinvestment portfolio from $11,833 million to $10,553 million. This significant decline in MET's securities lending and reinvestment portfolio suggests broader market pressures, such as reduced demand or asset devaluations, which could directly affect SCHW\u2019s collateral positions if similar assets are used as collateral. As a result, SCHW may face increased pressure to tighten collateral requirements, increase credit loss provisions, or reassess the valuation of securities used in lending activities to mitigate potential losses.",

        "Hop 1: SCHW \u2192 Securities Lending: SCHW explicitly identifies securities lending as a key credit risk exposure, particularly due to collateral adequacy and market volatility.",

        "Hop 3: Reinvestment Portfolio \u2190 MET: MET reported a significant year-over-year decline in both securities lending and reinvestment portfolio values, signaling potential market stress or asset devaluation that could affect collateral quality for firms like SCHW."

A majority of the Firm's  counterparties  for  these  derivatives  are  banks,  broker-dealers,  and insurance and other financial institutions.\n\nThe  fair  value  amounts  as  shown  in  the  previous  tables  are  prior  to  cash collateral or counterparty netting.\n\nThe purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the Firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. The Firm manages its exposure  to  these  derivative  contracts  through  a  variety  of  risk  mitigation strategies,  which  include  managing  the  credit  and  correlation  risk  across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and  cash  positions. Aggregate  market  risk  limits  have  been  established  for credit  derivatives,  and  market  risk  measures  are  routinely  monitored  against these limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under CDS where credit protection was sold.\n\nSingle-Name CDS. A CDS protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic  premium  (generally  quarterly)  over  the  life  of  the  contract  and  is protected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a CDS if a credit event  as  defined  under  the  contract  occurs.  Typical  credit  events  include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.\n\nIndex  and  Basket  CDS. Index   and  basket  CDS  are  products  where  credit protection  is  provided  on  a  portfolio  of  single-name  CDS.

CDOs  are  generally managed  by  third-party  portfolio  managers.  The  Corporation  typically  transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs.

      "answer": "The proposed shift from 0.5-percentage-point to 0.1-percentage-point increments in the G-SIB surcharge under the Federal Reserve's proposal would likely allow for more granular calibration of capital requirements for systemically important institutions like JPMorgan Chase. For JPM, this could mean a more tailored capital burden, which would interact with its 'single point of entry' resolution strategy where losses would first be imposed on equity holders and then on unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible long-term debt. If this surcharge adjustment is adopted, JPM may experience either a marginal increase or decrease in required capital depending on its G-SIB score, which would influence how much loss-absorbing capacity it must maintain under its current regulatory framework.",

      "question": "How does BLK's use of NAV for valuing illiquid investments compare to GS's exposure through its $2.7 billion unfunded commitments to private equity funds, considering the liquidity constraints described in NAV disclosures?",
      "answer": "BLK utilizes NAV as a practical expedient to value certain illiquid investments, including private equity funds, that lack readily determinable fair values. This aligns with NAV disclosures referenced in UPS's filings, which explain that NAV is commonly used for alternative investments like private equity funds, where redemptions are typically restricted until the end of the fund's term, often 10\u201315 years from inception. GS has substantial exposure to private equity funds, with $2.7 billion in unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2024, and its investments are generally not redeemable, with distributions dependent on the liquidation of underlying assets. Therefore, both BLK and GS rely on NAV for valuation, but GS faces direct capital exposure and liquidity risk tied to its $2.7 billion in commitments.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "Capital One is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks, with the Federal Banking Agencies expected to jointly adopt rules to implement this requirement. This aligns with JPMorgan\u2019s disclosures where the Dodd-Frank Act is referenced as a key regulatory framework affecting large financial institutions, particularly in terms of resolvability and capital constraints. Both firms face potential capital constraints due to the Act\u2019s provisions, such as the FDIC\u2019s orderly liquidation authority and the expectation that parent holding companies must support their subsidiaries, which could impact liquidity planning and capital adequacy assessments.",

If the Company were to fail to adequately address deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in a timely manner, it may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. In July 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC ex tended the deadline for the next full resolution submission from March 31, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required by FDIC regulation to submit its own resolution plan to the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule amending the resolution plan submission requirements applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank. Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the LTD Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Regulation Y  requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (this is known as the 'source of strength doctrine'). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and further requires the Federal Banking Agencies to jointly adopt rules implementing this requirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority.\n\n## FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ('DIF') maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio ('DRR') for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "BAC's $10.9 billion net notional credit default protection portfolio, which includes protection on funded and unfunded exposures, may overlap with instruments like CDOs in which MS has invested. MS has invested in CDOs that contain embedded derivatives where credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note.

      "question": "How does the lack of voting rights in Schwab's Series A Preferred Stock compare to Visa's governance structure for its preferred stockholders, particularly in terms of influence over corporate actions such as mergers or acquisitions?",
      "answer": "Schwab's Series A Preferred Stock does not have voting rights except in limited circumstances such as dividend non-payments, which restricts shareholder influence over corporate decisions. In contrast, Visa's preferred stockholders (Series B and C) have limited voting rights, particularly over defined matters such as mergers or acquisitions, where they can vote as a single class. However, Visa\u2019s Series A Preferred Stockholders gain voting rights similar to Class A common stockholders upon conversion, which Schwab\u2019s Series A holders do not receive under normal circumstances. This indicates a structural difference in how each company balances preferred shareholder influence over major corporate actions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SCHW \u2192 Series A Preferred Stock: Schwab's Series A Preferred Stock does not carry voting rights except in limited circumstances, such as dividend non-payments.",
        "Hop 2: Series A Preferred Stock \u2192 Voting Rights: AIG's Series A Preferred Stock is used as a reference point for how preferred stock typically lacks voting rights, reinforcing that Schwab's structure aligns with this standard.",
        "Hop 3: Voting Rights \u2190 V: Visa's Series B and C preferred stockholders have limited voting rights on specific matters like mergers, and Series A preferred stockholders gain voting rights upon conversion to Class A common stock, which contrasts with Schwab's more restrictive approach."

The shares of series B and C preferred stock are subject to restrictions on transfer and may become convertible in stages based on developments in the VE territory covered litigation. The shares of series B and C preferred stock will become fully convertible on the 12th anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition, subject only to a holdback to cover any then-pending claims. Upon any such conversion of the series B and C preferred stock  (whether  by  such  12th  anniversary,  or  thereafter  with  respect  to  claims  pending  on  such  anniversary),  the conversion rate would be adjusted downward and the holder would receive either class A common stock or series A preferred stock (for those who are not eligible to hold class A common stock pursuant to the Company's charter). The conversion rates may also be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities.\n\nThe series A preferred stock, generally designed to be economically equivalent to the Company's class A common stock, is freely transferable and each share of series A preferred stock will automatically convert into 100 shares of class A common stock upon a transfer to any holder that is eligible to hold class A common stock under the charter. See Note 5-U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.\n\nVoting rights. The holders of the series B and C preferred stock have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain  defined  matters,  including,  in  specified  circumstances,  any  consolidation,  merger,  combination  or  similar transaction of the Company in which the preferred stockholders would either (i) receive shares of common stock or other equity securities of the Company with preferences, rights and privileges that are not substantially identical to the preferences,  rights  and  privileges  of  the  applicable  series  of  preferred  stock  or  (ii)  receive  securities,  cash  or  other property that is different from what the Company's class A common stockholders would receive. With respect to these limited matters on which the holders of preferred stock may vote, approval by the preferred stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the outstanding voting power of each such series of preferred stock, each such series voting as a single class. In either case, the series B and C preferred stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares held by each such holder. Holders of the series A preferred stock, upon issuance at conversion, will have similar voting rights to the rights of the holders of the series B and C preferred stock.\n\nClass A common stockholders have the right to vote on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote. Class B and C common stockholders have no right to vote on any matters, except for certain defined matters, including (i) any decision to exit the core payments business, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will  vote  together  with  the  class A  common  stockholders  in  a  single  class,  and  (ii)  in  specified  circumstances,  any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction of the Company, in which case the class B and C common stockholders will vote together as a single class. In either case, the class B and C common stockholders are entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of class B or C common stock held multiplied by the applicable conversion rate in effect on the record date. Holders of the Company's common stock have no right to vote on any amendment to the current certificate of incorporation that relates solely to any series of preferred stock.",

      "answer": "AXP maintains 50% voting rights in GBT despite reducing its economic ownership to 41% following GBT's acquisition of Egencia, allowing continued influence over corporate decisions. MET has 24 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which aligns with AIG's disclosure that such preferred structures typically eliminate or severely restrict voting rights except in limited situations like dividend non-payments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A)\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## BUSINESS INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a globally integrated payments company with three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate &amp; Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\n\n- Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n- Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants\n- Network services\n- Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\n- Expense management products and services\n- Travel and lifestyle services\n\nOur various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. We have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). The commercial arrangements with GBT include, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBT uses the American Express brand, GBT's support of certain of our partnerships, joint negotiation with travel suppliers and a strategic relationship between GBT and our GCS business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT was reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT's acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights remain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG). Upon consummation of the business combination, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by APSG's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals, the terms of certain of our commercial arrangements with GBT will be amended and GBT will become a public company.\n\nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services:\n\n- Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., domestic or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged such as a variable fee for 'non-swiped' card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United States at merchants located in the United States;\n- Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;\n- Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account;\n- Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, service fees earned from merchants, travel commissions and fees, and Membership Rewards program fees; and\n- Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with our GNS partners (including commissions and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees, earnings (losses) from equity method investments (including GBT), insurance premiums, and prepaid card and Travelers Cheque-related revenue.",

      "answer": "The U.S. debit interchange regulation, which caps fees at 21 cents plus 5 basis points, directly constrains Visa\u2019s ability to use interchange rates as a competitive lever, thereby limiting its product differentiation strategy tied to network rules and incentive agreements. This regulatory constraint reduces Visa\u2019s influence over transaction economics, which in turn affects how it differentiates its offerings in the market. For Mastercard, the same regulation impacts the competitiveness of issuer-acquirer partners who rely on interchange as part of their revenue model. Since Mastercard depends heavily on these partners to maintain brand strength and market position, any regulatory pressure on interchange fees indirectly weakens its ecosystem\u2019s ability to innovate and compete, especially as issuers may reduce investment in differentiated payment programs due to lower returns. Both companies are thus constrained by the same regulation in distinct but interrelated ways: Visa through direct limitation on differentiation and Mastercard through the diminished competitiveness of its issuing and acquiring partners.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations.  See Item  1 -Business -Government  Regulation for  more  information  on  the  most  significant  areas  of regulation that affect our business. The impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability  to  enforce  our  payments  system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules; affect our existing contractual arrangements; increase our compliance costs; and require us to make our technology or intellectual property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below, we  may  face  differing  rules  and  regulations  in  matters  like  interchange  reimbursement  rates,  preferred  routing, domestic processing requirements, currency conversion, point-of-sale transaction rules and practices, privacy, data use or protection, licensing requirements, and associated product technology. As a result, the Visa operating rules and our other  contractual  commitments may differ from country to country or by product offering. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and reduces our revenue opportunities.\n\nIf widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as antimoney laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  services,  privacy  and  sanctions,  and  we  continually adjust  our  compliance  programs  as  regulations  evolve.  However,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  our  practices  will  be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event our controls should fail or we are found to be out of  compliance  for  other  reasons,  we  could  be  subject  to  monetary  damages,  civil  and  criminal  penalties,  litigation, investigations  and  proceedings,  and  damage  to  our  global  brands  and  reputation.  Furthermore,  the  evolving  and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, our brands, our competitive positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\n## Increased  scrutiny  and  regulation  of  the  global  payments  industry,  including  with  respect  to  interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1 -Business -Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the reverse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees are a factor on which we compete with other payments providers and are therefore an important  determinant  of  the  volume  of  transactions  we  process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether voluntarily or by mandate, can substantially affect our overall payments volumes and revenues.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions have reviewed or are reviewing these fees, rules and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve cap the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits issuers' and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business. In October 2022, the Federal Reserve published a final rule effectively requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks are available for routing card not present debit transactions by July 1, 2023. Various stakeholder groups are also advocating that the Federal Reserve further lower interchange fees on debit transactions and restrict the ability of  payments networks to enter into certain incentive and growth agreements with issuers. In addition, there continues to be interest in further regulation of interchange fees",

Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.\n\n## Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\n\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.\n\n## We  may  be  unable  to  expand  our  brand  portfolio  through  successful  acquisitions  or  the  development  of  strategic  business relationships, and the intended benefits from our investments may not materialize.\n\nOne  element  of  our  growth  strategy  is  to  expand  our  brand  portfolio  and  market  positions  through  selective  acquisitions  and  the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of  failing  to  achieve  efficient  and  effective  integration,  strategic  objectives  and/or  anticipated  revenue  improvements  and  cost  savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.

We compete for talent, including in areas that  are  new  to  us,  such  as  digital,  information  technology,  life  sciences,  with  companies  in  the  consumer  products,  technology, pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.",

          "chunk_text": "## Our  business  significantly  depends  on  the  continued  success  and  competitiveness  of  our  issuing  and  acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.\n\nWhile we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system, including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies, we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers' success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See our risk factor in 'Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations for further discussion.\n\nWith the exception of the United States and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus cards are authorized, cleared and settled by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not, as described above, have direct relationships  with  account  holders,  we  depend  on  our  close  working  relationships  with  our  customers  to  effectively  manage  our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Merchants' continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nMerchants  are  important  constituents  in  our  payments  system.  We  rely  on  both  our  relationships  with  them,  as  well  as  their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase  revenues  and  fight  fraud.  In  the  retail  industry,  there  is  a  set  of  larger  merchants  with  increasingly  global  scope  and influence.  We  believe  that  these  merchants  are  having  a  significant  impact  on  all  participants  in  the  global  payments  industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard  has  been  defending,  including  the  U.S.  merchant  litigations.  Some  merchants  are  increasingly  asking  regulators  to review  and  potentially  regulate  our  own  network  fees,  in  addition  to  interchange.  See  our  risk  factor  in  'Risk  Factors  -  Other Regulation' in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to payments industry regulation, including interchange fees. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment, including in connection with the growth of digital payments, may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nCertain  larger  merchants  are  also  able  to  negotiate  incentives  from  us  and  pricing  concessions  from  our  issuer  and  acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer.\n\n## Our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAs  we  increase  our  work  with  national,  state  and  local  governments,  both  indirectly  through  financial  institutions  and  with  them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions  in  governmental  operations,  could  impact  approved  funding  and  result  in  changes  in  the scope,  or  lead  to  the  termination,  of  the  arrangements  or  contracts  we  or  financial  institutions  enter  into  with  respect  to  our payment products and services.",

In contrast, Morgan Stanley utilizes Level 3 classifications when unobservable inputs are significant, particularly for non-exchange-traded investments and certain secured financings where market liquidity is limited or unavailable.

          "chunk_text": "ITEM 1 |\n\nBusiness\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nWe believe that our people are our greatest strength. To this end, we place the highest importance on human capital management; namely attracting, developing and retaining high caliber talent committed to our journey to becoming a top performing company and fostering an inclusive environment in which we actively seek and embrace diverse thinking.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately 36,600 employees based in approximately 50 countries, of which 48 percent are located in North America, 32 percent in the Asia Pacific region and the remaining 20 percent in the EMEA region and Latin America.\n\nWe believe that we foster a constructive and healthy work environment for our employees and colleagues. Some examples of key programs and initiatives that are designed to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits. Under the oversight of the Compensation and Management Resources Committee of our Board of Directors (CMRC), we seek to align the compensation of our employees with individual and Company performance and provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve outstanding results.\n\nManagement and the CMRC engage the services of third-party compensation consultants and advisors to help us monitor the market competitiveness of our incentive programs. We provide a performance-driven compensation structure that consists of base salary and, for eligible employees, short- and long-term incentives. We also offer comprehensive benefits to support the health and wellness needs of our colleagues, including subsidized health care plans, life insurance and disability, wellness and mental health benefits, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, parental leave policies and matching 401(k) contributions and matching charitable donations, for eligible employees.\n\nHealth and Safety. AIG cares about the health and safety of its employees. Occupational safety and health is a shared responsibility between employees and corporate stakeholders, which we implement through our Global Safety and Environment policy. We take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, to provide a safe and healthy work environment, and to meet regulatory and duty of care responsibilities regarding the health, safety and welfare of employees engaging in AIG business activities. For example, in response to COVID-19 in 2020, we quickly and effectively transitioned 90 percent of our employees to remote work and established a cross-functional task force to ensure that AIG implemented best practices to protect the safety of colleagues while continuing to serve clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders. Where permitted by local laws and regulations, our offices are open to fully vaccinated employees, even so we have continued our work from home availability. Mask mandates, social distancing, and office capacity limits have been implemented to comply with local law. Additionally, we have strict quarantine and contact tracing protocols in place in the event a positive COVID-19 case occurs.\n\nNearly every country in which we operate has an Employee Assistance Program, which provides employees with mental health resources, including counseling sessions and webinars. We also funded a pandemic financial assistance program to provide financial assistance to employees in the form of low or no-interest loans. Further, in December 2020, we launched our Compassionate Colleagues Fund with an initial contribution of $2 million by AIG. The fund has helped more than 700 employees overcome serious financial hardships and disasters. Since then, voluntary employee donations together with company matches of these contributions have continued to grow the size of the fund designed to enable employees to help their fellow colleagues.\n\nTalent Development. AIG is committed to offering a multitude of learning and development opportunities for our colleagues. AIG has developed numerous programs to foster leadership, growth and development opportunities for our employees. We believe that professional development is a positive investment in our talent. Our goal is to build our employees' skills and fuel a culture of development, change agility, and transformational readiness across the Company through learning and development experiences. To support this, AIG provides colleagues with a centralized destination where they can access a personalized learning platform that includes a variety of programs to support employee growth. We have also developed a core, globally consistent curriculum that focuses on key skills that are important to our business and sets up colleagues for success in their career. In addition, we offer tuition, certification and training reimbursement programs to encourage employees to enhance their education, skills and knowledge for their continued growth.\n\nThe Company places significant importance and attention on promoting internal talent and succession planning. Accordingly, we review our talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and operating segments annually, to identify and develop a pipeline of diverse talent for positions at all levels of the organization. In 2021, we developed a globally consistent, streamlined process to encourage robust discussions around succession pipelines and the development of critical talent. In 2021, 28.3 percent of all our open positions were filled with internal talent.\n\n8 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K",

      "answer": "PayPal faces significant risk from rapid technological changes, particularly in payment methods like BNPL and cryptocurrency, which could render its current offerings obsolete if not adopted timely. Visa, on the other hand, strategically partners with these alternative payment providers while also competing with them, leveraging its global network and security advantages to maintain relevance. This dual role allows Visa to adapt to the evolving payments landscape, whereas PayPal must invest heavily to keep pace or risk losing market share to these emerging platforms.",

          "chunk_text": "If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.\n\nRapid,  significant,  and  disruptive  technological  changes  impact  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  for  example,  payment technologies  (including  real-time  payments,  payment  card  tokenization,  virtual  currencies,  distributed  ledger  and  blockchain technologies,  and  proximity  payment  technology  such  as  Near  Field  Communication  and  other  contactless  payments);  internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.\n\nWe expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve. We cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business, which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted, and how those technologies may be regulated. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors, for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies. These third parties may restrict or prevent our access to, or utilization of, those technologies, as well as their platforms or products. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment, take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. Our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be limited or  restricted  by  industry-wide  standards,  platform  providers,  payments  networks,  changes  to  laws  and  regulations,  changing expectations of consumers or merchants, third-party intellectual property rights, and other factors. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business could be harmed.\n\n## LEGAL, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\nOur  business  is  subject  to  extensive  government  regulation  and  oversight.  Our  failure  to  comply  with  extensive,  complex, overlapping, and frequently changing rules, regulations, and legal interpretations could materially harm our business.\n\nOur business is subject to complex and changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners, including, but not limited to, those governing: banking, credit, deposit taking, crossborder and domestic money transmission, prepaid access, foreign currency exchange, privacy, data protection, data governance, cybersecurity, banking secrecy, digital payments, cryptocurrency, payment services (including payment processing and settlement services), fraud detection, consumer protection, antitrust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.\n\nRegulators globally have been establishing and increasing their regulatory authority, oversight, and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business. As we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets, including through acquisitions, we expect  to  become  subject  to  additional  regulations,  restrictions,  and  licensing  requirements.  As  we  expand  and  localize  our international activities, we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase. In addition, because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws, which may impose different, more specific, or conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability.\n\nAny failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any government authority (including changes to or expansion of their interpretation) may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of  significant  assets,  and  enforcement  actions  in  one  or  more  jurisdictions;  result  in  additional  compliance  and  licensure requirements; cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny of our business; divert management's time and attention from our business; restrict our operations; lead to increased friction for customers; force us to make changes to our business practices, products or operations; require  us  to  engage  in  remediation  activities;  or  delay  planned  transactions,  product  launches  or  improvements.  Any  of  the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The complexity of United States ('U.S.') federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government  authorities  in  different  jurisdictions.  While  we  have  implemented  policies  and  procedures  designed  to  help  ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations.",

Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the U.S., Interac in Canada and eftpos in Australia.\n\nDigital Wallet Providers: They continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for consumers and merchants. While digital wallets can help drive Visa volumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options.\n\nAlternative Payments Providers: These providers, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale.

In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.\n\nReal-time  Payment  (RTP)  Networks: RTP  networks  have  launched  in  multiple  markets,  mainly  driven  by government sponsorship and regulatory intervention. These networks primarily focus on domestic transactions, with adoption  varying  by  use  cases  and  geographies.

This includes a wide range of  players,  such  as  technology  companies,  information  services  and  consulting  firms,  governments  and  merchant services companies. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas.\n\nWe  believe  our  fundamental  value  proposition  of  security,  convenience,  speed  and  reliability  as  well  as  the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed.

We will continue to utilize our network of networks  strategy  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  money.  We  believe  Visa  is  well-positioned  competitively  due  to  our global brand, our broad set of payment products, new flows offerings and value added services, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  global  regulations  in  the various  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  and  services  are  used.

We are also subject to antimoney laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are included  on  OFAC's  list  of  Specially  Designated  Nationals  and  Blocked  Persons,  to  issue  or  acquire  Visa  cards  or engage in transactions using our services.",

      "question": "How does Capital One's exposure to the Market Risk Rule, which adjusts capital ratios based on trading book risks, compare with JPMorgan Chase's regulatory capital requirements under Basel III, particularly in relation to their respective trading asset thresholds and VaR methodologies?",
      "answer": "Capital One (COF) is subject to the Market Risk Rule due to its trading assets and liabilities exceeding $1 billion or 10% of total assets, requiring adjustments to its risk-based capital ratios. This rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules, which are also central to JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) regulatory capital framework. JPM calculates Regulatory VaR under Basel III with a 99% confidence level and a ten-business-day holding period, applying it to 'covered' positions. In contrast, COF\u2019s capital adequacy is evaluated under Basel III standardized and proposed Expanded Risk-Based Approaches, with the latter phasing in by 2028. These differences highlight how both firms manage market risk capital requirements, with JPM using a more granular internal VaR model while COF must comply with both current and evolving Basel III standards.",

The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion or more. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and the Bank are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See 'Part II \u4e00 Item 7. MD&amp;A \u4e00 Market Risk Profile' for additional information.\n\n## Basel III Finalization Proposal\n\nIn July 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking ('Basel III Finalization Proposal') to revise the Basel III Capital Rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their subsidiary depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would introduce a new framework for calculating risk-weighted assets ('Expanded Risk-Based Approach'). An institution subject to the proposal would be required to calculate its risk-weighted assets under both the Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the existing Basel III standardized approach and, for each risk-based capital ratio, would be bound by the calculation that produces the lower ratio. All capital buffer requirements, including the stress capital buffer requirement, would apply regardless of whether the Expanded Risk-Based Approach or the existing Basel III standardized approach produces the lower ratio. The proposal would also replace the existing approach for calculating market risk with a new approach based on both internal models and standardized methodologies.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would also make certain changes to the calculation of regulatory capital for Category III and IV  institutions. Under the proposal, these institutions would be required to begin recognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1 capital, including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities. The proposal would also generally reduce the threshold above which these institutions must deduct certain assets from their CET1 capital, including certain deferred tax  assets, mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a proposed effective date of July 1, 2025, subject to a three-year transition period ending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted assets calculated under the Ex panded Risk-Based Approach and the recognition of AOCI in CET1 capital would be phased in. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the Basel III Finalization Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ('FDICIA') requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take PCA for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well capitalized; adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution. The capital categories relate to FDICIA's PCA provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank's overall financial condition or prospects.\n\nFor an insured depository institution to be well capitalized, it must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or more; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a leverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for Category III and certain other institutions, a supplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## Value-at-risk\n\nJPMorganChase utilizes v alue-at-risk ('VaR'), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adv erse market mov es in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the prev ious 12 months. The framework's approach assumes that historical changes in market v alues are representativ e of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believ es the use of Risk Management VaR prov ides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, prov ides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk ev ents.\n\nThe Firm's Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence lev el. Risk Management VaR prov ides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and lev els of div ersification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported as appropriate to v arious groups including senior management, the Board Risk Committee and regulators.\n\nUnderlying the ov erall VaR model framework are indiv idual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for indiv idual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm's risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activ ities giv e rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market v alues ov er the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitiv ities and historical time series used to generate daily market v alues may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm lev el.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on av ailable historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or sev ere shifts in market conditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and av ailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not av ailable. It is likely that using an actual pricebased time series for these products, if av ailable, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.\n\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, the daily market data used may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly v aluation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observ able, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm's v aluation process.\n\nThe Firm's VaR model calculations are periodically ev aluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improv ements in the Firm's modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 160 for information regarding model rev iews and approv als.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules ('Regulatory VaR'), which is used to deriv e the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten businessday holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence lev el. Regulatory VaR is applied to 'cov ered' positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR. For example, credit deriv ativ e hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit deriv ativ e hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm's Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the div ersification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorganChase's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are av ailable on the Firm's website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respectiv e backtesting).",

This methodology leads to a potentially more favorable risk assessment for AIG's CMBS holdings. MET also applies NAIC designations to CMBS, but the evidence suggests MET primarily relies on NAIC-published comparisons of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, rather than third-party modeling.

In general, NAIC Designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. NAIC Designations for non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the NAIC. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG subsidiaries' fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. For fixed maturity securities where no NAIC Designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the NAIC Designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating.\n\nThe NAIC Designations presented below do not reflect the added granularity to the designation categories adopted by the NAIC in 2020, which further subdivide each category of fixed maturity securities by appending letter modifiers to the numerical designations.\n\nFor a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see -Credit Ratings below .\n\nThe following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:\n\n",

Similarly, Bank of America states that operational risk\u2014including theft\u2014is a component in the calculation of total RWA used in Basel 3 capital calculations, indicating that both institutions explicitly factor theft-related risks into their capital planning.

By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks  related  to  various  foreign  currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities  and eliminate  substantially  all  foreign  currency  exposures  in  the  cash  flows  of  the Corporation's  non-trading  foreign  currency-denominated  financial  instruments. These  foreign  exchange  derivatives  are  sensitive  to  other  market  risk  exposures such  as  cross-currency  basis  spreads  and  interest  rate  risk.  However ,  as  these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 - Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Mortgage Banking Risk Management\n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment  or  held  for  sale  at  th e  time  of  commitment  and  manage  credit  and liq uid ity risks b y selling or securitizing a p ortion of th e loans we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date  of  th e  IR LC  a nd   th e  d a te  th e  loa ns  a re  sold   to  th e  second a ry  m a rket.  A n increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these  instruments.  Conversely ,  when  there  is  an  increase  in  interest  rates,  th e value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the  interest  rate  risks  of  th ese  h ed ged   items  offset,  we  comb ine  th em  into  one overall  h ed ged   item  with   one  comb ined   economic  h ed ge  portfolio  consisting  of derivative contracts and securities.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or  damage  to  the  reputation  of  the  Corporation  arising  from  the  failure  of  the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable LRRs and our internal policies and procedures (collectively , applicable LRRs). We  are subject to comprehensive  and  evolving  regulation  under  federal  and  state  laws,  rules  and regulations in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including  those  related  to  financial  crimes  and  anti-money  laundering,  market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy , data protection, development and use of AI, and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  or systems,  people or external events, and  includes legal risk. Operational  risk  may  occur  anywhere  in  the  Corporation,  including  third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces  a  number  of  key  operational  risks  including  third-party  risk,  model  risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. The pace of technological change, including in the field of AI, may heighten risks in those areas. Operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and i s a component in the  calculation  of  total  R WA  used  in  th e  Basel  3  capital  calculation.  For  more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 48.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and  control  functions  are  required  to  understand  their  business  processes  and related  risks  and  controls,  including  third-party  dependencies  and  the  related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment.  In  order  to  actively  monitor  and  assess  the  performance  of  their processes  and  controls,  they  must  conduct  comprehensive  quality  assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally , FLUs  and  control  functions  are  responsible  for  the  proactive  identification, management  and  escalation  of  compliance  and  operational  risks  across  the Corporation. Collectively , th ese efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency , which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption. T o address AI-related risks, we have implemented internal processes and governance  frameworks.  These  measures  help  with  regulatory  compliance  and responsible use of AI across our operations.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational  risk,  monitor  business  activities  and  processes  and evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable LRRs, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting on the state of the control environment. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of  key  compliance  and  operational  risk  processes  and  controls  across  the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance - Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management - Enterprise Policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational  risk  information  to  executive  management  as  well  as  the  Board  or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk's  responsibilities  for  conducting  independent  oversight  of  the  Corporation's compliance  and  operational  risk  management  activities.  The  Board  provides oversight  of  compliance  risk  through  its  Audit  Committee  and  the  ERC,  and operational risk through its ERC.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nCybersecurity is a key operational risk facing the Corporation. We, our employees, customers,  regulators  and  third  parties  are  ongoing  targets  of  an  increasing number of cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks and, accordingly , the Corporation devotes considerable resources to the establishment and maintenance of processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risk through its global workforce and  2 4/7 cyber operations centers around  the world. The Corporation takes a cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with our  Global  T echnology ,  Global  Risk  Management,  Legal  and  Corporate  Audit functions  playing  key  roles.  In  addition,  th e  Corporation's  processes  related  to cybersecurity  risk  are  an  element  of  and  integrated  with  the  Corporation's comprehensive risk program, including our risk framework.

The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate. We make estimates  regarding  the  valuation  of  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair value  in  preparing  the  financial  statements.  These  assets  and  liabilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Trading assets and Trading liabilities;\n- Investment Securities-AFS;\n- Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;\n- Loans held-for-sale (measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value);\n- Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit;\n- Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;\n- Certain Other secured financings; and\n- Certain Borrowings.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer  a  liability  (i.e.,  the  ex it  price)  in  an  orderly  transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs, and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring  that  the  relevant  observable  inputs  be  used  when  available.  The hierarchy is broken down into three levels: wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and  Level  3  consists  of  valuation  techniques  that  incorporate  significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair  values  for  the  substantial  majority  of  our  financial  assets  and  liabilities carried  at  fair  value  are  based  on  observable  prices  and  inputs  and  are classified in level 1 or 2, of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 0.9% and 1.2% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs, as well as market liquidity, may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the  valuation  of  many  instruments  carried  at  fair  value.  Imprecision  in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of  gain  or  loss  recorded  for  a  particular  position.  The  Firm  uses  various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the  Firm could result  in  a  different  estimate  of  fair  value  at  the  reporting  date.  For  further information on the\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\ndefinition  of  fair  value,  Level  1,  Level  2,  Level  3  and  related  valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  valuation  adjustments  are  made  to  account  for  various factors,  such  as  liquidity  risk  (bid-ask  adjustments),  credit  quality,  model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding, in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments, including, in  part,  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  that  are  subject  to  uncertainty. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. G oodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to  a  reporting  unit. As  such,  all  the  activities  of  a  reporting  unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative  impairment  test  or  (ii)  first  perform  a  qualitative  assessment  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.\n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  goodwill  impairment loss is equal to the ex cess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use  for  each  of  the  reporting  units.  The  estimated  fair  value  is  generally determined  by  utilizing  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology.  In  certain instances,  we  may  also  utilize  methodologies  that  incorporate  price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of comparable companies.\n\nThe  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  uses  projected  future  cash  flows based  on  the  reporting  units'  earnings  forecast.  The  discount  rate  used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

Risk Factors Liquidity on page 9.\n\n## Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances. In addition, under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may  be  appointed  receiver  in  order  to  conduct  an  orderly  liquidation  of  such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority , instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary  of  the  T reasury  makes  certain  financial  distress  and  systemic  risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThe  orderly  liquidation  authority  contains  certain  differences  from  the  U.S. Bankruptcy  Code.  For  example,  in  certain  circumstances,  the  FDIC  could  permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors' consent or prior court review . The insolvency  and  resolution  process  could  also  lead  to  a  large  reduction  or  total elimination of the value of a BHC's outstanding equity , as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt.\n\nUnder the FDIC's 'single point of entry' strategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could  replace  a  distressed  BHC  with  a  bridge  holding  company ,  which  could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that BHCs maintain minimum levels of long-term debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution.\n\nFor  more  information  regarding  our  resolution,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  Liquidity on page 9.\n\n## Limitations on Acquisitions\n\nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits a BHC to acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to state law , subject to certain conditions, including the condition that the BHC, after and as a result of the acquisition, controls no more than 1 0 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. At June 30, 2024, we held greater than 1 0 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S.\n\nIn  addition,  th e  Financial  R eform  Act  restricts  acquisitions  by  a  financial institution  if,  as  a  result  of  th e  a cq uisition,  th e  tota l  lia b ilities  of  th e  fina ncia l institution would  exceed  1 0  percent  of  the  total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. At June 30, 202 4, our liabilities did not exceed 1 0 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in th e U .S.\n\n## The Volcker Rule\n\nThe V olcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (collectively , banking entities) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options for their own account. The V olcker Rule also imposes limits on banking entities'  investments  in,  and  other  relationships  with,  hedge  funds  and  private equity funds. The V olcker Rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker or custodian. A banking entity with significant trading  operations,  such  as  the  Corporation,  is  required  to  maintain  a  detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the Volcker Rule.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nOur derivatives businesses are subject to extensive regulation globally , including under  the  Financial  Reform  Act,  the  European  Union  (EU)  Markets  in  Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation,  analogous  U.K.  regulatory  regimes  and  similar  regulatory  regimes  in other  jurisdictions.  These  regulations,  among  other things,  require  clearing  and exchange  trading  of certain derivatives, establish capital, margin,  reporting, registration  and  business  conduct  requirements  for  certain  market  participants, set position limits on certain derivatives and set out derivatives trading transparency requirements.\n\nIn  addition,  many  G-20  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.S.,  EU,  U.K.,  and   Japan, have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial contracts could impede orderly resolution of G-SIBs, and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit. Generally , these regulations require  amendment  of  certain  financial  contracts  to  provide  for  contractual recognition  of  stays  of  termination  rights  under  various  statutory  resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of cross-default rights based on an affiliate's entry into insolvency proceedings. Resolution regulations may  also require contractual  recognition  by  the  counterparty  that  amounts  owed  to  them  may  be written  down  or  converted  into  equity  as  part  of  a  bail  in.  As  resolution  stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into effect, we amend impacted  financial  contracts  in  compliance  with  such  regulations  either  as  a regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in such jurisdiction.\n\n## Consumer Regulations\n\nOur  consumer  businesses  are  subject  to  extensive  regulation  and  oversight  by federal and state regulators. Certain federal consumer finance laws to which we are subject, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,",

The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to certain supported subsidiaries,  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  secured  amended  and  restated support agreement.\n\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and of the Funding IHC, respectively, under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets), and the assets of  the  Funding  IHC,  as  applicable. As  a  result,  claims  of  certain  supported subsidiaries,  including  the  Funding  IHC,  against  the  assets  of  the  Parent Company  with  respect  to  such  secured  assets  are  effectively  senior  to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or  in  a  resolution  proceeding  under  the  orderly  liquidation  authority,  is intended  to  result  in  better  outcomes  for  creditors  overall,  there  is  no guarantee that the application of an SPOE strategy, including the provision of support  to  the  Parent  Company's  supported  subsidiaries  pursuant  to  the secured amended and restated support agreement, will not result in greater losses  for  holders  of  our  securities  compared  with  a  different  resolution strategy for us.\n\nRegulators  have  taken  and  proposed  various  actions  to  facilitate  an  SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority and other  resolution  regimes.  For  ex ample,  the  Federal  Reserve  requires  top-tier BHCs  of  U.S.  G -SIBs,  including  the  Firm,  to  maintain  adequate  TLAC, including  equity  and  eligible  long-term  debt,  in  order  to  ensure  that  such institutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized  through  the  conversion  of  debt  to  equity  or  otherwise  by imposing  losses  on  eligible  TLAC  where  the  SPOE  strategy  is  used.  The combined  implication of the SPOE  resolution  strategy  and  the  TLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible longterm debt and other forms of eligible  TLAC issued by the  Parent  Company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.K.  and  E.U.  jurisdictions, have  implemented  changes  to  resolution  regimes  to  provide  resolution authorities  with  the  ability  to  recapitalize  a  failing  entity  organized  in  such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity. Such 'bail-in' powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors. This may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, including in times of stress. Non-U.S. regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\namounts  of  TLAC  that  would  pass  losses  up  from  the  subsidiaries  to  the Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent Company in the event of failure.\n\n## We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements.\n\nWe are  subject  to  comprehensive  consolidated  supervision,  regulation  and examination  by  the  Federal  Reserve,  including  with  respect  to  regulatory capital  requirements,  stress  testing  and  capital  planning.  We  submit,  on  at least  an  annual  basis,  a  capital  plan  to  the  Federal  Reserve  describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take.  Our  ability  to  take  capital  actions  described  in  the  capital  plan  is dependent  on,  among  other  factors,  the  results  of  supervisory  stress  tests conducted by the Federal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our  operating  ex penses  or  constrain  our  ability  to  take  capital  actions.  For additional  information,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.'\n\n## The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations, and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability.\n\nAs  a  global  financial  services  firm,  we  face  the  risk  of  investigations  and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in all countries  in  which  we  conduct  our  business.  These  investigations  and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, continue to impact the financial services industry. Certain U.S. and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions, pleas, deferred prosecution agreements or nonprosecution  agreements  from  financial  institutions.  Significant  regulatory  or law  enforcement  action  against  us  could  materially  adversely  affect  our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations, and increase our exposure to civil litigation.\n\nInvestigations  and  proceedings  initiated  by  these  authorities  may  result  in adverse  judgments,  settlements,  fines,  penalties,  disgorgement,  restitution, forfeiture, injunctions or other relief, and have included and may in the future include requirements that the Firm admit certain conduct, which may result in increased exposure to civil litigation. In addition, these measures have caused and  may  in  the  future  cause  collateral  consequences.  For  ex ample,  such matters could impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "In  addition,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.K.  and  the  E.U.,  have implemented resolution  regimes  to  provide  resolution  authorities  with  the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting  its  unsecured  debt  into  equity.  Such  'bail-in'  powers  are intended  to  enable  the  recapitalization  of  a  failing  institution  by  allocating losses  to  its  shareholders  and  unsecured  debtholders.  For  example,  the Bank of  England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we  provide  to  our  material  U.K.  subsidiaries  to  contain  a  contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such 'bail-in' powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to  our  subsidiaries  is  'bailed  in,'  Group  Inc.'s  claims  on  its  subsidiaries would  be  subordinated  to  the  claims  of  the  subsidiaries'  third-party creditors  or  written  down.  U.S.  regulators  are  considering  and  non-U.S. authorities  have  adopted  requirements  that  certain  subsidiaries  of  large financial  institutions  maintain  minimum  amounts  of  total  loss-absorbing capacity  that  would  pass  losses  up  from  the  subsidiaries  to  the  top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.\n\n## The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater los s es  for Group Inc.'s  s ecurity holders .\n\nIn  our  resolution  plan,  Group  Inc.  would  be  resolved  under  the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of  the  single  point  of  entry  strategy:  Group  Inc.  and  Goldman  Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including  through  the  forgiveness  of  intercompany  indebtedness,  the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful,  creditors  of  some  or  all  of  Group  Inc.'s  major  subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.'s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In  exchange  for  an  unsecured  subordinated  funding  note  and  equity interest,  Group  Inc.  transferred  certain  intercompany  receivables  and substantially  all  of  its  GCLA  to  Funding  IHC,  and  agreed  to  transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\n\nWe also  put  in  place  a  Capital  and  Liquidity  Support Agreement  (CLSA) among  Group  Inc.,  Funding  IHC  and  our  major  subsidiaries.  Under  the CLSA,  Funding  IHC  has  provided  Group  Inc.  with  a  committed  line  of credit  that  allows  Group  Inc.  to  draw  sufficient  funds  to  meet  its  cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed  line  of  credit  will  automatically  terminate  and  the  unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany  receivables  owed  by  the  major  subsidiaries  to  Group  Inc. will  be  transferred to  Funding  IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its  remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to  fund  anticipated  bankruptcy  expenses)  to  Funding  IHC,  and  (iv) Funding  IHC  will  be  obligated  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.'s and Funding IHC's obligations under the  CLSA  are  secured  pursuant  to  a  related  security  agreement.  Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.'s liquidity. As a result,  during  a  period  of  severe  stress,  Group  Inc.  might  commence bankruptcy  proceedings  at  an  earlier  time  than  it  otherwise  would  if  the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\n\nIf  Group  Inc.'s  proposed  resolution  strategy  were  successful,  Group Inc.'s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group  Inc.'s  major  subsidiaries  would  incur  no  losses  because  those subsidiaries would  continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy  proceedings. As  part  of  the  strategy,  Group  Inc.  could  also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries' derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols,  as  applicable,  which  would  result  in  holders  of  Group  Inc.'s eligible  long-term  debt  and  holders  of  Group  Inc.'s  other  debt  securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and other  debt  securities  could  incur  losses  ahead  of  other  similarly  situated creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries.\n\nIf  Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.'s  financial  condition  would  be  adversely  impacted  and  Group  Inc.'s security  holders,  including  debtholders,  may  as  a  consequence  be  in  a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any  payments  to  debtholders  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  make  such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.",

      "answer": "V's Class B Common Stock grants no voting rights except for specific corporate actions, such as exiting the core payments business, where Class B stockholders vote together with Class A stockholders. In contrast, Charter's Class B Common Stock, issued to A/N, has voting power directly reflecting A/N's economic interests in Charter Holdings on an as-exchanged basis. JPMorgan's evaluation of VIE consolidation considers economic interests, including equity investments and other variable interests, to determine if those interests are potentially significant to the VIE. Thus, while V limits Class B voting rights to defined circumstances, Charter explicitly aligns its Class B voting power with economic interests, a structure that would factor into JPMorgan's analysis of whether such an arrangement constitutes a variable interest significant enough to warrant VIE consolidation.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley's capital buffer requirement under the Advanced Approach includes a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB), which is currently set at zero by the Federal Reserve. This means Morgan Stanley must maintain Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital above minimum requirements based on the sum of the 2.5% buffer, G-SIB surcharge, and CCyB. Similarly, American Express National Bank is subject to the same regulatory framework, which includes CET1 capital requirements that incorporate the capital conservation buffer. However, since the CCyB is currently at zero, it does not increase their total CET1 capital requirement above the baseline. Both institutions are subject to the same Federal Reserve rules regarding CET1 capital maintenance above minimum risk-based requirements, but only the capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge (if applicable) are currently contributing to their CET1 requirements.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs is subject to the SCB rule with a 2.5% floor under the FRB's CCAR stress testing framework, which limits capital distributions unless the firm resubmits its capital plan. This creates a structured but potentially restrictive environment for dividend planning. Meanwhile, American Express's subsidiary AENB paid $5.0 billion in dividends in 2024, but remains constrained by similar Federal Reserve rules that prohibit dividend payments if they would cause the bank to fall below regulatory capital requirements or if deemed unsafe. The comparison reveals that while both firms face the same overarching regulatory constraints, AENB was able to distribute significant capital in 2024, suggesting either stronger capital adequacy or a different risk profile relative to GS under the SCB framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Dividend Limitations: GS is subject to the SCB rule with a 2.5% floor, requiring FRB approval for capital distributions if there\u2019s a material change in risk profile or if the FRB directs resubmission of its capital plan.",
        "Hop 2: Dividend Limitations \u2192 AENB: AENB faced similar Federal Reserve dividend restrictions and paid $5.0 billion in dividends in 2024, but only after ensuring compliance with capital adequacy and regulatory approval standards.",

The FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and  Review  (CCAR)  is  designed  to  ensure  that  large  BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times  of  economic  and  financial  stress.  As  required  by  the  FRB,  we perform  an  annual  capital  stress  test  and  incorporate  the  results  into  an annual  capital  plan,  which  we  submit  to  the  FRB  for  review.  See 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital  Capital  Management  -  Capital  Planning  and  Stress  Testing  Process'  in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital  plan.  As  described  in  'A vailable  Information'  below,  summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions  across  a  range  of  macroeconomic  and  company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB's own stress tests. In December 2024  and  February  2025,  the  FRB  indicated  that  it  intends  to  propose significant changes to the stress test framework in 2025 and, for the 2025 stress  test,  take  steps  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  results  and  to  begin  to improve  model  transparency.  Also  in  December  2024,  trade  groups representing  major  U.S.  banks,  including  us,  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the FRB concerning certain inadequacies with its stress testing process.\n\nUnder the FRB's rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated  assets,  including  us,  the  SCB  applies  to  the  Standardized approach capital requirements. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends.  The  SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission  of  a  capital  plan.  See  'A vailable  Information'  below  and 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital'  in Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Form  10-K  for  information  about  our  SCB requirement.\n\nThe  SCB  rule  requires  a  BHC  to  receive  the  FRB's  approval  for  any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit  its  capital  plan,  which  may  occur  if  the  BHC  determines  there has  been  or  will  be  a  'material  change'  in  its  risk  profile,  financial condition  or  corporate  structure  since  the  plan  was  last  submitted,  or  if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan.\n\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more  that  are  subsidiaries  of  U.S.  G-SIB s,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA,  are required  to  submit  annual  company-run  stress  test  results  to  the  FRB . GSBE  also has its own  capital and stress testing process,  which incorporates  internally  designed  stress  tests  and  those  required  under German  regulatory  requirements  and  the  ECB  Guide  to  Internal  Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally  designed  stress  tests  developed  in  accordance  with  the  PRA 's ICAAP guidelines.\n\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal and state laws impose  limitations  on  the  payment  of  dividends  by U.S.  depository institutions,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA.  In  general,  the  amount  of  dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the  recent  earnings  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  if  the  total  of  all dividends  declared  by  the  entity  in  any  calendar  year  is  in  excess  of  the current  year's  net  income  combined  with  the  retained  net  income  of  the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the  undivided  profits  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  in  excess  of  the entity's undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been  paid  out  as  dividends  or  transferred  to  surplus),  unless  the  entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval.\n\nThe applicable  U.S.  banking  regulators  have  authority  to  prohibit  or  limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n\nSource  of  Strength. The  Dodd-Frank  Act  requires  BHCs  to  act  as  a source  of  strength  to  their  U.S.  bank  subsidiaries  and  to  commit  capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the  FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to  provide  it.  Capital  loans  by  a  BHC  to  a  U.S.  subsidiary  bank  are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness  of  the  subsidiary  bank.  In  addition,  if  a  BHC  commits  to  a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source-ofstrength  authority  or  in  response  to  other  regulatory  measures,  that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.",

It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on preferred and common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies are required by statute to be a source of strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries and should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to do so. On an annual basis, we are required to develop and maintain a capital plan, which includes planned dividends. We may be subject to limitations and restrictions on our dividends, if, among other things, (i) our regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) we are required to resubmit our capital plan.\n\n## BANK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, AENB paid dividends from retained earnings to its parent of $5.0 billion. AENB is limited in its ability to pay dividends by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy. In general, applicable federal and state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as AENB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available retained earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. If AENB's risk-based capital ratios do not satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and applicable buffers, it will face graduated constraints on dividends and other capital distributions. In determining the dividends to pay its parent, AENB must also consider the effects on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies. In addition, AENB's banking regulators have authority to limit or prohibit the payment of a dividend by AENB under a number of circumstances, including if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.",

The use of social media and similar channels has the potential to intensify and accelerate such a decrease in confidence in soundness.\n\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENB's capital levels. The FDIA's brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. Additionally, our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\n\n## The value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic, political or market conditions.\n\nMarket risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables, which could negatively impact our financial condition. We have experienced realized and unrealized losses in our Amex Ventures equity investments and may experience further losses in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $1.2 billion of investment securities, primarily consisting of debt securities, and equity investments, including certain equity method investments, totaling approximately $2.0 billion. Negative market conditions, changes in valuations or increases in default rates or bankruptcies with respect to these investments, due to economic conditions, business performance or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments, potentially resulting in impairment charges.

      "question": "How does the Dodd-Frank Act's imposition of central clearing requirements affect BlackRock's derivatives compliance costs and operational complexity compared to Schwab's derivatives-related prudential standards under the same regulation?",
      "answer": "The Dodd-Frank Act imposes central clearing requirements on certain swaps transactions, which increases BlackRock\u2019s compliance costs and operational complexity due to the need for new monitoring procedures, execution on registered venues, and margin posting for non-cleared derivatives. These requirements particularly impact BlackRock\u2019s derivatives trading strategies involving interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. Meanwhile, under the same Dodd-Frank framework, Charles Schwab is subject to enhanced prudential standards including risk management, liquidity stress testing, and single counterparty credit limits starting in 2021 and 2022 respectively, which also raise its compliance burden and operational constraints. While both firms face increased regulatory scrutiny, BlackRock\u2019s exposure centers on trading operations and margin requirements, whereas Schwab\u2019s obligations focus on capital and risk management infrastructure.",

        "Hop 1: BLK \u2192 Central Clearing Requirements: BlackRock must comply with mandatory central clearing of certain swaps, execution on electronic venues, and margin posting, increasing complexity and cost for its derivatives trading operations.",

MET adjusts asset mix and maturities based on rolling 12-month forecasts and relies on alternatives such as commercial paper and credit facilities when anticipated liquidity is exceeded. Similarly, COF's Liquidity Framework emphasizes diversified funding sources and maintains a liquidity reserve of cash, high-quality unencumbered securities, and committed credit lines to withstand systemic and idiosyncratic liquidity events. Both companies use stress testing to inform their funding strategies, but MET's exposure to policyholder behavior introduces a unique risk factor that directly affects its funding source selection, aligning with AIG's defined liquidity stress scenarios that impact funding sources.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## The Company\n\n## Liquidity\n\nLiquidity refers  to  the  ability  to  generate  adequate  amounts  of  cash  to  meet  our  needs. We  determine  our  liquidity  needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities  based  on  this  rolling  12-month  forecast.  To  support  this  forecast,  we  conduct  cash  flow  and  stress  testing,  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\n\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings could also negatively affect our liquidity. See '- Rating Agencies.'  If  we  require  significant  amounts  of  cash  on  short  notice  in  excess  of  anticipated  cash  requirements  or  if  we  are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact  our  financial  condition.  See  'Risk  Factors  -  Investment  Risks  -  We  May  Have  Difficulty  Selling  Holdings  in  Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value.'\n\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\n\n## Capital\n\nWe  manage  our  capital  position  to  maintain  our  financial  strength  and  credit  ratings.  See  '-  Rating  Agencies'  for information  regarding  such  ratings.  Our  capital  position  is  supported  by  our  ability  to  generate  strong  cash  flows  within  our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\n\n## Statutory Capital and Dividends\n\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\n\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an  early  warning  regulatory  tool  to  identify  possible  inadequately  capitalized  insurers  for  purposes  of  initiating  regulatory action,  and  not  as  a  means  to  rank  insurers  generally.  These  rules  apply  to  most  of  our  U.S.  insurance  subsidiaries.  State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial  statements  filed  with  insurance  regulators,  the  total  adjusted  capital  of  each  of  these  subsidiaries  subject  to  these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\n\nAs a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business  in  Delaware  or  any  other  U.S.  state,  it  is  exempt  from  RBC  requirements  under  Delaware  law.  American  Life's operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions  in  which  it  operates  and  is  subject  to  capital  and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. In commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees. In addition to sound underwriting, we closely monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit Officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure  and  performance  of  our  lending  related  transactions.  Our  Consumer  and  Commercial  Chief  Credit  Officers  are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new  credit  investments.  They  also  have  formal  approval  authority  for  various  types  and  levels  of  credit  decisions,  including individual  commercial  loan  transactions.  Division  Presidents  within  each  segment  are  responsible  for  managing  the  credit  risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur  credit  policies  establish  standards  in  five  areas:  customer  selection,  underwriting,  monitoring,  remediation  and  portfolio management.  The  standards  in  each  area  provide  a  framework  comprising  specific  objectives  and  control  processes.  These standards  are  supported  by  detailed  policies  and  procedures  for  each  component  of  the  credit  process.  Starting  with  customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. We use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. We monitor  performance  relative  to  these  guidelines  and  report  results  and  any  required  mitigating  actions  to  appropriate  senior management committees and our Board of Directors.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management\n\nWe manage liquidity  risk  by  applying  our  Liquidity  Framework.  The  Liquidity  Framework  uses  internal  and  regulatory  stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery Plans, which include the Company's policies, procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. The Liquidity Framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Liquidity  Framework  establishes  governing  principles  that  apply  to  the  management  of  liquidity  risk.  We  use these  principles  to  monitor,  measure  and  report  liquidity  risk;  to  develop  funding  and  investment  strategies  that  enable  us  to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with the Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant  funding  degradation  through  systemic,  idiosyncratic,  and  combined  liquidity  stress  scenarios.  Management  reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees no less than quarterly and to our Board of Directors no less than semi-annually.\n\nWe seek to mitigate  liquidity  risk  strategically  and  tactically.  From  a  strategic  perspective,  we  have  acquired  and  built  deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. From a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed collateralized credit lines. We also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. This combination of stable  and  diversified  funding  sources  and  our  stockpile  of  liquidity  reserves  enable  us  to  maintain  confidence  in  our  liquidity position.\n\n## Market Risk Management\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level.

      "answer": "Rising interest rates, which Citigroup identifies as a potential cause of financial market disruptions that it models in its liquidity stress testing, could reduce the value of JPMorganChase's available-for-sale (AFS) securities held in its investment portfolio, as higher rates make existing lower-yielding securities less attractive. JPMorganChase notes that losses on AFS securities are a specific risk from interest rate increases. In contrast, Schwab measures the fair value of its fixed income investments using third-party pricing services that incorporate observable market data like benchmark interest rates and spreads, and validates these values against multiple sources to ensure reasonableness.

          "chunk_text": "## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\n## Overview\n\nAdequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi's businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely outside of Citi's control, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in Citi's credit ratings and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, see 'Risk Factors-Liquidity Risks' above.\n\nCiti's funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to resolution planning (see 'Resolution Plan' and 'Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)' below). Citigroup's primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:\n\n- Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and\n- Citi's non-bank and other entities, including the parent holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi's primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi's broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup (including Banamex).\n\nAt an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi's goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and highquality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that, in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress tests.\n\nCiti's primary funding sources include (i) corporate and consumer deposits via Citi's bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders' equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.\n\nCiti's funding and liquidity framework, working in concert with overall asset/liability management, helps ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability structure (including funding products) of the Company relative to the liquidity requirements of Citi's assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized. The Company holds excess liquidity, primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as presented in the table below.\n\nCiti's liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury, reported within Corporate/Other in All Other , in conjunction with regional and in-country treasurers with oversight provided by Independent Risk Management and various Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) at the individual entity, region, country and business levels. Pursuant to this approach, Citi's HQLA are managed with emphasis on asset/liability management and entity-level liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.\n\nCiti's CRO and CFO co-chair Citigroup's ALCO, which includes Citi's Treasurer and other senior executives. The ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance (see 'Risk Governance-Board and Executive Management Committees' above). Significant changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the ALCO. Citi also has other ALCOs, which are established at various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight for individual entities, countries, franchise businesses and regions, serving as the primary governance committees for managing Citi's balance sheet and liquidity.\n\nAs a supplement to Citigroup's ALCO, Citi's Funding and Liquidity Risk Committee (FLRC) is focused on funding and liquidity risk matters. The FLRC reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of, as well as risk management practices for, Citigroup and Citibank and reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant ALCO as appropriate.\n\n## Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement\n\n## Stress Testing\n\nLiquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi's major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries. Stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position, in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand to manage through such an event. These scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of funding and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as Company-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis.\n\nGiven the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effectiv e, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market ev ents were to occur.\n\n## Credit\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and gov ernment entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can inv olv e JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults.

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses.

No allowance is established in these situations and any previously recorded allowance is reversed. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fix ed maturity  security  before recov ery  of its amortiz ed cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\n\nFor fix ed maturity  securities for which a decline in the fair v alue below the amortiz ed cost is due to credit related factors, an allowance is established for the difference between the estimated recoverable value and amortized cost with a corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses). The allowance for credit losses is limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not associated with credit related factors is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fix ed maturity  securities on which an allowance for credit losses was previously recognized (a separate component of A OCI). A ccrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows for structured fixed maturity securities (e.g., RM BS, CM BS, CLO, A BS) management considers the historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and the priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:\n\n- Current delinquency rates;\n- Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n- Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n- Expected prepayment speeds.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows for corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers:\n\n- Expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n- Loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n- Scenarios specific to the issuer and the security, which may also include estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability  and financial strength of the issuer, the v alue of any  secondary  sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.\n\nWe consider severe price declines in our assessment of potential credit impairments. We may also modify our model inputs when we determine that price movements in certain sectors are indicative of factors not captured by the cash flow models.\n\nUnder the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, credit losses are reassessed each period. The allowance for credit losses and the corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses) can be reversed if conditions change, however, the allowance for credit losses will never be reduced below zero. When we determine that all or a portion of a fix ed maturity  security  is uncollectable, the uncollectable amortiz ed cost amount is written off with a corresponding reduction to the allowance for credit losses. If we collect cash flows that were previously written off, the recovery is recognized by recording a gain in Net realized gains (losses).\n\n128\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase's exposure to Stress Capital Buffer requirements influence its capital distribution constraints compared to Charles Schwab's obligations under the Capital Conservation Buffer, given the composition of their respective regulatory buffer requirements?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase is subject to a Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) as part of its regulatory capital requirements, which could increase based on stress loss estimates from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. This buffer, along with the GSIB surcharge and countercyclical buffer (CCyB), contributes to JPMorgan\u2019s total capital buffer requirement. On the other hand, Charles Schwab\u2019s banking subsidiary, Charles Schwab Bank (CSB), is required to maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 2.5%, which imposes restrictions on capital distributions if not met. According to regulatory definitions, the CCB is a fixed component of capital buffer requirements, whereas JPMorgan\u2019s SCB is dynamic and tied to stress testing outcomes. Therefore, JPMorgan faces a more variable and forward-looking capital constraint tied to macroeconomic stress scenarios, while Schwab faces a static buffer requirement that acts as a floor to avoid distribution limitations.",

        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 Stress Capital Buffer: JPMorgan Chase is subject to a Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), which can increase based on stress loss estimates from the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR process.",
        "Hop 2: Stress Capital Buffer \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: The Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) is a fixed 2.5% requirement under standardized approaches and is part of the broader capital buffer framework that also includes the SCB and GSIB surcharge.",
        "Hop 3: Capital Conservation Buffer \u2190 SCHW: Charles Schwab Bank (CSB) is required to maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%, and failure to meet this buffer would result in restrictions on capital distributions and executive bonuses."

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

      "answer": "GS's broker-dealer subsidiaries held $113,996 million in assets as of Q4 2024, making them directly subject to Regulation Best Interest, which governs recommendations to retail investors and imposes conduct standards. MET, as a company explicitly subject to Regulation Best Interest, faces compliance costs and operational adjustments due to its broker-dealer subsidiaries' obligations, including increased disclosure requirements, conflicts of interest management, and potential litigation risks. MET's distribution model, which relies on unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers that must comply with Regulation Best Interest, further amplifies these costs and risks. Therefore, while GS's exposure is asset-scale driven and operational in nature, MET's exposure is more compliance and distribution focused, with heightened regulatory scrutiny over third-party sales channels.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Standards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\n\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the 'DOL'), the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n\nThe prohibited transaction rules of  ERISA and the  Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to  ERISA plans and participants and to  Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\n\nIn  2021,  the  DOL 's  final  version  of  the  prohibited  transaction  ex emption  ('PTE')  2020-02  went  into  effect,  which  allows  investment  advice  fiduciaries  to  receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of 'fiduciary' for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of 'fiduciary' and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors.\n\nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products.\n\nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms 'advisor' or 'adviser' without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\n\nIn  January  2025,  the  Chilean  Congress  approved  a  major  pension  reform  bill,  which  improves  pensions  by  increasing  employer  contributions,  correcting  certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile's Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDodd-Frank also expanded the definition of 'swap' and mandated the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') to study whether 'stable value contracts' should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the definition and the SEC's and CFTC's interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries, other than stable value contracts, might also be treated as swaps. Special federal banking rules apply to certain derivatives contracts and other agreements with some banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally limit or delay the rights of counterparties upon the insolvency of such banking institutions which could increase our counterparty risk.\n\nIn  2024,  the  principal  U.S.  federal  banking  regulatory  agencies  reproposed  for  public  comment  regulations  to  implement  certain  international  'Basel  III'  capital standards, which could affect capital charges applicable to banks and their affiliates engaged in derivatives activities. This could increase the costs of our risk mitigation using derivatives, as well as impact the availability of derivatives from our counterparties.\n\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency  to  submit  for  clearing  eligible  secondary  market  transactions  in  U.S.  Treasury  securities.  The  rule  effectively  requires  such  participants  to  clear  eligible  cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the rule effectively requires eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to be cleared beginning on June 30, 2026. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule's potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\n\n## Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\n\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that meet the definition of a 'security,' including variable annuity contracts and variable  life  insurance  policies,  and  certain  fix ed  interest  rate  or  index -linked  contracts  with  features  that  require  them  to  be  registered  as  securities  or  ex empt  from registration. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\n\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered 'securities' under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\n\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies with separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 'Investment Company Act') or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 'Securities Act') or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One of our insurance subsidiaries issues a fix ed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered under the Securities Act.\n\nCertain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.\n\nTwo of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose and adopt rules and regulations that impact broker-dealers and products deemed to be securities. One of our U.S. broker-dealers serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of these variable products and other securities offerings. Our broker-dealer distributes these products via unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that sell these products to end investors. Under SEC rules, these selling broker-dealers are required to comply with various SEC and FINRA rules and regulations, including Regulation Best Interest. SEC rules also require these selling broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a 'best interest' standard for the sale of annuities. All of our insurance subsidiaries' domiciliary states have adopted the model regulation or another form of the best interest standard.",

      "answer": "Visa's conversion mechanism for Class B common stock into Class A common stock is conditional and subject to adjustment based on the resolution of U.S. covered litigation and follow-on offerings, which affects the conversion rate. Recently, Visa accepted 241 million shares of Class B-1 common stock in an exchange offer, issuing 120 million shares of Class B-2 and 48 million shares of Class C common stock in return. This contrasts with Mastercard's straightforward one-for-one conversion policy for eligible holders of Class B common stock into Class A common stock, which is restricted to entities defined in its certificate of incorporation and requires subsequent sale or transfer of Class A shares received. The conditional nature of Visa's conversion rate adjustments and the introduction of new classes of stock in exchange programs create a more complex and potentially more volatile future share structure compared to Mastercard\u2019s simpler and more predictable conversion mechanism.",

      "answer": "For Bank of America, the absence of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) means its total Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital buffer requirement under the Advanced Approaches framework is the sum of its G-SIB surcharge of 2.5% and the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, totaling 5.0%. Similarly, Morgan Stanley\u2019s CET1 capital buffer requirement under the same framework is also the sum of its G-SIB surcharge (which is not quantified in the provided data but assumed to be included), the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, and the zero CCyB. Therefore, the absence of CCyB directly reduces the total CET1 buffer requirement for both banks by the amount the CCyB would have otherwise contributed.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Countercyclical Capital Buffer: BAC is subject to regulatory capital requirements, and as of December 31, 2023, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer was zero. BAC's CET1 capital buffer under the Advanced Approaches includes its G-SIB surcharge of 2.5% and the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%, totaling 5.0% in the absence of CCyB.",
        "Hop 2: Countercyclical Capital Buffer \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: The Capital Conservation Buffer is a required component of the total capital buffer framework, and in the absence of a CCyB requirement, it remains a fixed 2.5% for both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.",
        "Hop 3: Capital Conservation Buffer \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley is also subject to the same capital buffer framework, where the capital buffer requirement under the Advanced Approaches includes the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%, its G-SIB surcharge, and the zero CCyB. This implies a similar reduction in CET1 requirements due to the absence of CCyB."

This framework emphasizes independent assurance, control environment maintenance, and accountability for risk remediation. In contrast, PayPal faces direct financial exposure from fraud through its payments platform, incurring substantial losses from unauthorized transactions, protection programs, and chargebacks, with mitigation efforts focused on detection systems and recovery mechanisms.

          "chunk_text": "## Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit\n\nInternal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior management and regulators over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls that mitigate current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit and reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit Committee and administratively to Citi's CEO. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and issues identified through Internal Audit's activities.\n\n## Enterprise Support Functions\n\nEnterprise support functions engage in activities that support safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in maintaining an effective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions are composed of Human Resources and Global Legal Affairs and Compliance (exclusive of ICRM, which is part of the second line of defense). Front line units may also include enterprise support units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the Controllers Group within Finance).\n\nEnterprise support functions, units and activities are subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable (e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).\n\n## Risk Governance\n\nCiti's ERM Framework encompasses risk management processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi's commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk management practices.\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the Executive Management Team accountable for implementing the ERM Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi's risk appetite.\n\n## Executive Management Team\n\nThe Citigroup CEO directs and oversees the day-to-day management of Citi as delegated by the Board of Directors. The CEO leads the Company through the Executive Management Team and provides oversight of group activities, both directly and through authority delegated to committees established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure continued alignment with Citi's risk strategy.\n\n## Board and Executive Management Committees\n\nThe Board executes its responsibilities either directly or through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its oversight and risk management responsibilities:\n\n- Audit Committee : assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to (i) the integrity of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements, financial reporting process and systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (ii) the performance of the internal audit function (Internal Audit), (iii) the annual independent integrated audit of Citigroup's consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of Citigroup's internal control over financial reporting, the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Auditors) and the evaluation of the Independent Auditors' qualifications, independence and performance, (iv) holding management accountable for the effectiveness of Citigroup's control environment and status of corrective actions, including the timely remediation of control breaks (including, without limitation, significant compliance or operational control breaks), (v) policy standards and guidelines for risk assessment and risk management, (vi) Citigroup's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including Citigroup's disclosure controls and procedures and (vii) the fulfillment of the other responsibilities set out in the Audit Committee's Charter.\n- Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee : is responsible for overseeing compensation of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and Citi management's sustained focus on fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible conduct and accountability within the organization. The Committee regularly reviews Citi's management resources and the performance of senior management. The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and approving the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and members of Citi's Ex ecutive Management Team. The Committee is also responsible for approving the incentive compensation structure for other members of senior management and certain highly compensated employees (including discretionary incentive awards to covered employees as defined in applicable bank regulatory guidance), in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee from time to time. The Committee also has broad oversight over compliance with bank regulatory guidance governing Citi's incentive compensation.\n- Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee : is responsible for (i) identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending to the Board the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board's performance, (iii) recommending to the Board directors for each committee for appointment by the Board, (iv) reviewing the Company's policies and programs that relate to public issues of significance to the",

Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where linked accounts designated by customers to fund PayPal transactions have insufficient funds or are otherwise unavailable to fund the payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services,  damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims. While we actively seek to recover transaction losses where possible, such recoveries may be insufficient to compensate us for such losses.\n\nOur purchase and seller protection programs ('protection programs') are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from unauthorized and  fraudulent  transactions.  Our  purchase  protection  program  also  protects  consumers  who  do  not  receive  the  item  ordered  or  who  receive  an  item  that  is significantly different from its description. We incur substantial losses from our protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers. While we may seek to recover losses from our protection programs from the merchant, we ultimately may not be able to fully recover such losses (for example, if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay, the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant, or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered).\n\nIn addition, consumers who pay through PayPal or V enmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer, which in turn will seek recovery from us. If losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive, we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment, which would negatively impact our business. Regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud, which could increase PayPal's exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our protection programs. Increases in our loss rate, including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our protection programs, could negatively impact our business and results of operations. See 'Note 13-Commitments and ContingenciesProtection Programs ' to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFailure  to  effectively  monitor  and  evaluate  the  financial  condition  of  our  merchants  may  ex pose  PayPal  to  losses.  In  the  event  of  the  bankruptcy,  insolvency, business failure, or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (e.g., airline, cruise, or concert tickets, custom-made goods, and subscriptions), we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services, including through our purchase protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their purchase. Allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses.\n\n## Use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business.\n\nWe expect that users will continue to attempt to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illegal telemarketing activities, illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software, movies, music, and other copyrighted, trademarked or digital goods, bank fraud, child pornography, human trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, securities fraud, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity. Moreover, certain activity  that  may  be  legal  in  one  jurisdiction  may  be  illegal  in  another  jurisdiction,  and  a  merchant  may  be  found  responsible  for  intentionally  or  inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods, resulting in liability for us. Owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions, including PayPal, that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items by a user. While we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur on our payments platform, these measures may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal  activity  or  improper  uses,  and  we  may  be  subject  to  claims,  individual  and  class  action  lawsuits,  and  government  and  regulatory  requests,  inquiries,  or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business.\n\n## Acquisitions, dispositions, strategic investments, and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business.\n\nWe expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business",

      "answer": "BlackRock discloses that its reliance on key technology partners like Microsoft for hosting Aladdin on Azure introduces operational and execution risks, including infrastructure reliability, software security, and regulatory oversight, which could lead to reputational harm or legal liability if not managed properly. Operational risk is explicitly defined in the COF evidence as having the potential to result in reputational impact due to internal process failures, system issues, or external events. Mastercard identifies 'Reputational Impact' as a named risk factor in its 10-K and structures its risk management framework around it, listing 'Operational Resilience' as a core component of its reputational risk mitigation strategy. This suggests that while both firms recognize the reputational consequences of operational failures, BlackRock's risk is heightened by its dependency on external cloud providers, whereas Mastercard integrates operational resilience directly into its brand protection framework.",

T ransactions with counterparties expose BlackR ock's clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackR ock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties m ay be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit m arkets that m ay im pair their ability to perform  or they m ay fail to m eet their obligations. C ounterparties m ay also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk m anagem ent system s or expose BlackR ock and/or its clients to losses resulting from  em ployee m alfeasance, negligence or hum an error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackR ock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays im pacting multiple BlackR ock clients. Any such operational issue, im pairm ent or failure could negatively im pact the perform ance of products that BlackR ock m anages for its clients, which m ay lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nThe failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock's growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackR ock depends on a num ber of key third-party providers for various fund adm inistration, accounting, custody, m arket and environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') data, market indices, insurance, technology and AI, cloud hosting and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. F urther, BlackR ock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients' investm ent decisions. T he index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term  contracts rem ains the m arket standard. T his industry structure m ay lim it BlackR ock's ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable term s or at all. W hile BlackR ock perform s focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations and required obligations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there m ay be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackR ock's operations and processes rely on com m ercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process delays and failures or failures to com ply with data usage requirem ents with respect to these service providers m ay adversely im pact BlackR ock. D ata providers com m only disclaim  the accuracy and com pleteness of data and BlackR ock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and com pleteness of com m ercially sourced datasets. M oreover, in situations where BlackR ock has lim ited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackR ock's arrangem ent with a vendor requires a long term -com m itm ent, BlackR ock m ay be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and m ay incur additional costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.\n\nBlackR ock m ay from  tim e to tim e transfer key contracts from  one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers m ay be costly and com plex and expose BlackR ock to heightened operational and legal risks. Any failure to m itigate such risks could result in reputational harm  as well as financial losses to BlackR ock and its clients. T he failure or inability of BlackR ock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients' investm ent managem ent or other agreem ents, have an adverse financial im pact on BlackR ock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the C om pany, which could result in reputational harm  or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Any disruption to the Company's distribution channels may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackR ock relies on a num ber of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio adm inistration and servicing for certain BlackR ock investm ent m anagem ent products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackR ock's ability to m aintain strong relationships with its distributors m ay im pact the C om pany's future perform ance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that m ay result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the am ount of BlackR ock products and services being m arketed or distributed. M oreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business m odels and m ore lim ited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or m arketing of certain of the C om pany's products and services and fee com pression. If BlackR ock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangem ents, BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings m ay decline. In addition, im proper activities, as well as inadequate antimoney laundering and sanctions diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm  to BlackR ock.\n\n## Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.\n\nBlackR ock has a num ber of key strategic partnerships, including with M icrosoft. F or instance, the Aladdin infrastructure and environm ent for BlackR ock and its external Aladdin clients are hosted on M icrosoft Azure. BlackR ock has also m igrated certain system s that support its corporate functions to cloud-based platform s. T he benefits of cloud-based platform s are significant and BlackR ock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its m igration strategies. H owever, these partnerships also introduce new risks, including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and inform ation security risks arising from  the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new com pliance obligations, which risks m ay be further exacerbated as BlackR ock and the Aladdin platform  continue to grow. A prolonged global failure of cloud services could also im pact BlackR ock's other system s. F ailures by BlackR ock to m anage these risks, and/or risks associated with future technology partnerships, m ay result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm  or legal liability, which, in turn, m ay cause BlackR ock's AU M , revenue and earnings to decline.",

U.S.  self-regulatory  organizations,  such  as FINRA  and  the  NYSE,  have  adopted  rules  that  apply  to  broker-dealers, such as GS&amp;Co.\n\nOur  principal  subsidiaries  operating  in  Europe  include:  Goldman  Sachs International (GSI),  Goldman  Sachs  International  Bank (GSIB),  Goldman Sachs  Asset  Management  International  (GSAMI),  Goldman  Sachs  Bank Europe SE (GSBE), Goldman Sachs  Asset Management B.V .,  and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC).\n\nOur  E.U.  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  various  E.U.  regulations,  as  well  as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSBE is directly  supervised  by  the  European  Central  B ank  (ECB )  and  additionally by  BaFin  and  Deutsche  Bundesbank  in  the  context  of  the  E.U.  Single Supervisory  Mechanism.  GSBE  engages  in  certain  activities  primarily  in the  E.U.,  including  underwriting  and  market  making  in  debt  and  equity securities  and  derivatives,  investment,  asset  and  wealth  management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial  advisory  services.  GSBE  is  also  registered  with  the  CFTC  as  a swap dealer and with the  SEC as a security-based swap dealer and as a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. Like our other foreign bank subsidiaries, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB's Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting  and  market  making  in  equity  securities  based  on  GSBE's and/or GS Bank USA's capital.\n\nGSPIC is an investment firm under the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and the French Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC's activities include certain  activities  that  GSBE  is  prevented  from undertaking. GSPIC is subject to the E.U. Investment Firm Regulation, the prudential regime for E.U. investment firms.\n\nGSI is a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB is a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As a designated investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements similar to those applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements.  GSI  provides  broker-dealer  services  in  and  from  the  U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending)  and  deposit-taking  activities  (including  by  taking  retail  deposits) and  is  a  primary  dealer  for  U.K.  government  bonds.  GSI  and  GSIB maintain  branches  outside  of  the  U.K.  and  are  subject  to  the  laws  and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located.\n\nOur  principal  subsidiary  operating  in Asia  is  Goldman  Sachs  Japan  Co., Ltd.  (GSJCL).  GSJCL is our regulated  Japanese broker-dealer subsidiary and is  regulated  by  Japan's  Financial  Services Agency,  the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\n\n## Banking Supervision and Regulation\n\nThe  Basel  Committee  is  the  primary  global  standard  setter  for  prudential bank regulation. However,  the Basel Committee's  standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules  to  implement  its  standards.  The  implications  of  B asel  Committee standards  and  related  regulations  for  our  businesses  depend  to  a  large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\n\nCapital  and  Liquidity  Requirements. We  and  GS  Bank  USA  are subject to risk-based regulatory capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB  (Capital Framework).  The  Capital  Framework  is  largely  based  on  the Basel Committee's framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management  of  banks  (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies'  tailoring  framework,  we  and  GS  Bank  USA  are  subject  to 'Category  I'  standards  because  we  have  been  designated  as  a  global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are 'Advanced approach' banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements  that  involve  quantitative  measures  of  assets,  liabilities  and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\n\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements  Directive,  as  amended  (CRD),  which  are  largely  based  on Basel III.\n\nGSI  and  GSIB  are  subject  to  the  U.K.  capital  and  liquidity  frameworks prescribed  in  the  PRA  Rulebook  and  the  U.K.  Capital  Requirements Regulation,  which  are  also  largely  based  on  B asel  III  and  are  generally aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks.",

Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Regulatory Capital Framework\n\nThe  Firm  is  an  FHC  under  the  Bank  Holding  Company  Act  of  1956,  as amended,  and  is  subject  to  the  regulation  and  oversight  of  the  Board  of Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  ('Federal  Reserve').  The  Federal Reserve  establishes capital requirements for the Firm, including 'wellcapitalized' standards, and evaluates the Firm's compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's U.S. bank subsidiaries, including, among others, MSBNA and MSPBNA  (together, 'U.S. Bank Subsidiaries'). The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement certain provisions of the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform and  Consumer  Protection Act.  In  addition,  many  of  the  Firm's  regulated  subsidiaries  are  subject  to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap  dealers  with  the  CFTC  or  conditionally  registered  as  security-based swap  dealers  with the SEC  or  registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Requirements\n\nThe  Firm  is  required  to  maintain  minimum  risk-based  and  leverage-based capital  ratios  under  regulatory  capital  requirements.  A  summary  of  the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows.\n\nRisk-Based  Regulatory  Capital. Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to  Common  Equity  Tier  1  ('CET1')  capital,  Tier  1  capital  and  Total  capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the Firm's capital buffer requirement. Capital  requirements  require  certain  adjustments  to,  and  deductions  from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.\n\nCECL  Deferral. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the Firm elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on its risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA,  adjusted average assets  and supplementary  leverage  exposure  calculations,  over  a  five-year  transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022 and were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024. The deferral impacts were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n\n## Capital B uffer R equirements\n\n",

      "answer": "MA's dual-class structure grants Class B common stock 15 votes per share, with all outstanding shares held by Mr. Brian L. Roberts, representing 33\u2153% of the combined voting power, while Class A common stockholders collectively hold 66\u2154% of the voting power. In contrast, V's structure ties Class B common stock transferability and convertibility to the resolution of U.S. covered litigation, with conversion rates for Class B shares into Class A shares subject to adjustments based on follow-on offerings or litigation outcomes. Additionally, V's Class C common stock has no transfer restrictions, and its exchange program allows for partial release of restrictions on Class B shares, further differentiating its control mechanisms from MA's more static voting power allocation.",

      "question": "How does MET's valuation methodology for its Foreign Government Securities, which relies on matrix pricing inputs, compare to AIG's use of matrix pricing for fixed maturity securities in terms of dependency on broker quotes versus model-derived valuations?",
      "answer": "MET discloses that its Foreign Government Securities are primarily valued using the market approach, with key inputs including quoted prices in non-active markets, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, issuer spreads, and broker-dealer quotations. When broker quotes are unavailable, matrix pricing is used. Similarly, AIG states that fixed maturity securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets when available, and when not, they rely on third-party valuation service providers that use methodologies including matrix pricing, benchmark yields, and credit spreads. MET also notes the use of independent non-binding broker quotations for Level 3 valuations, while AIG incorporates internal models that consider credit risk and market-observable data. Both companies use matrix pricing as a fallback when direct market data is lacking, but AIG places more emphasis on third-party service providers and internal modeling, whereas MET highlights broker-dealer quotations more explicitly.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value.\n\n- U.S. and Foreign Government Securities : U.S. and foreign government securities consist of investments in Treasury Nominal Bonds and Inflation Protected Securities and municipal securities. Government securities are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Corporate Debt Instruments : Corporate debt instruments are valued at a price that is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information, such as broker quotes. Matrix pricing, yield curves and indices are used when broker quotes are not available.\n- Common Stock : Common stocks are valued based on the price of the security as listed on an open active exchange on last trade date.\n- Collective Investment Funds : Collective investment funds consist of funds that are intended to mirror indices such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index. They are valued on the basis of the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets of each of the respective collective investment funds. The underlying assets are valued based on the net asset value ('NAV'), which is provided by the investment account manager as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. These investments are not classified by level but are disclosed to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets.\n\nCash Flows: Altria makes contributions to the pension plans to the extent that the contributions are tax deductible and pays benefits that relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. Currently, Altria anticipates making employer contributions to its pension and postretirement plans of up to approximately $30 million for each in 2022. However, the foregoing estimates of 2022 contributions to the pension and postretirement plans are subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes in interest rates, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return for each respective plan.\n\nEstimated future benefit payments at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels discussed above, and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.\n\n## VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nOur Own Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for certain liabilities incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to us at the balance sheet date by reference to observable AIG credit default swaps (CDS) or cash bond spreads. We calculate the effect of credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates. A derivative counterparty's net credit exposure to us is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with us, as well as collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date. For a description of how we incorporate our own credit risk in the valuation of embedded derivatives related to certain annuity and life insurance products see - Embedded Derivatives within Policyholder Contract Deposits below.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/DAAAAA+LiberationSerif-Bold&gt;\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk. Fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for us to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads will be used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. Our net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\n\nFair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk. Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information.\n\nFor fair values measured based on internal models, the cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name CDS spreads for each specific counterparty, the mid-market value of the net exposure (reflecting the amount of protection required) and the weighted average life of the net exposure. CDS spreads are provided to us by an independent third party. We utilize an interest rate based on the benchmark LIBOR curve to derive our discount rates.\n\nWhile this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs, we believe this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities, including consideration of the impact of non-performance risk.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities\n\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets.\n\nWe employ independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information to derive fair value estimates for individual investments, based upon market-accepted methodologies and assumptions. The methodologies used by these independent third-party valuation service providers are reviewed and understood by management, through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third-party valuation service providers. In addition, as discussed further below, control processes are applied to the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to ensure the accuracy of these values.\n\nValuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of market-accepted valuation methodologies, which may utilize matrix pricing, financial models, accompanying model inputs and various assumptions, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from completed transactions for identical securities and transactions for comparable securities, benchmark yields, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates, default rates, recovery assumptions, currency rates, quoted prices for similar securities and other market-observable information, as applicable. If fair value is determined using financial models, these models generally take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information.

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs has significant investments in real estate funds that globally target loan portfolios and property, with these funds being closed-end and illiquid, making distributions dependent on the liquidation of underlying assets. Meanwhile, Citigroup reported $7.6 billion in net credit losses for 2024 across its cards portfolios, driven by the maturation of recent loan vintages and macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and rising interest rates. Both institutions are exposed to financial assets tied to consumer debt, but while GS co-invests in real estate funds that include loan portfolios as a core asset class, C directly manages loan portfolios (e.g., Branded Cards and Retail Services) that are experiencing rising credit losses due to lower FICO band customers and reduced payment rates.",

The increase in noninterest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher net credit losses, and an increase in interchange fees (see Note 5), driven by higher card spend volume in Branded Cards. The increase in non-interest revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs in Branded Cards, driven by the higher card spend volume.\n\nCards revenues increased 7%. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, primarily driven by interest-earning balance growth (up 9%), as payment rates continued to moderate, and card spend volume growth. Branded Cards average loans increased 9%, also reflecting the lower card payment rates and higher card spend volume. Branded Cards spend volume increased 4%, driven by higher FICO band customers.\n\nRetail Services revenues increased 8%, primarily driven by higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see 'Provisions' below and Note 5), as well as higher net interest income on growth in interest-earning balances. Retail Services average loans increased 3%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates, partially offset by lower card spend volume. Retail Services card spend volume decreased 5%, primarily due to lower in-store foot traffic.\n\nRetail Banking revenues decreased 1%, driven by the impact of the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth , partially offset by higher deposit spreads, as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. Average mortgage loans increased 15%, primarily driven by lower refinancings due to higher interest rates and higher mortgage originations. Average deposits decreased 17%, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to Wealth ($17 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months).\n\nExpenses decreased 1%, driven by continued productivity savings and lower technology costs, partially offset by higher volume-related ex penses.\n\nProvisions were $8.6 billion, compared to $6.7 billion in the prior year, largely driven by higher net credit losses, partially offset by a lower ACL build for loans.\n\nNet credit losses of $7.6 billion increased 45%, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase. Branded Cards net credit losses of $4.0 billion and Retail Services net credit losses of $3.2 billion increased 51% and 39%, respectively.\n\nThe net ACL build was $1.0 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year.

Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Business\n\n'MetLife' and the 'Company' refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is one of the world's leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into six segments: G roup Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions ('RIS'); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA'); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate &amp; Other. See Note 2 for further information on the Company's segments and Corporate &amp; Other.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company's business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities ('VIEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe Company uses either the equity method of accounting or the fair value option ('FVO') for its investments in real estate joint ventures ('REJV ') and other limited partnership interests ('OLPI') when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee's operations. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee's earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag in instances where the investee's financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee's reporting period differs from the Company's reporting period.\n\n## Held-for-Sale\n\nThe Company classifies a business as held-for-sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current estimated fair value and certain other specified criteria are met. The business classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of the carrying value and estimated fair value, less cost to sell. If the carrying value of the business ex ceeds its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, a loss is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses). If the estimated fair value subsequently increases prior to sale, a gain is recognized and reported in net investment gains (losses) but will not exceed the losses recognized since the business was classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities related to the business classified as held-for-sale are separately reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business first meets all the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale and in each reporting period thereafter until sold. See Note 3. If a component of the Company has either been disposed of or is classified as heldfor-sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the results of the component are reported in discontinued operations.\n\n## Separate Accounts\n\nSeparate accounts are established in conformity with insurance laws. G enerally, the assets of the separate accounts cannot be used to settle the liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities. The Company separately reports, as separate account assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and corresponding policyholder liabilities of the same amount if all of the following criteria are met:",

The Level 2 asset category includes certain separate accounts that are primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities. The estimated fair value of such separate accounts is based upon reported NAV  provided by fund managers and this value represents the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated through observable market data. Directly held investments are primarily invested in U.S. and foreign government and corporate securities. The Level 3 asset category includes separate accounts that are invested in assets that provide little or no price transparency due to the infrequency with which the underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to liquidate in an orderly manner. Accordingly, the values for separate accounts invested in these alternative asset classes are based on inputs that cannot be readily derived from or corroborated by observable market data.",

      "question": "How does BAC's market-making gains related to embedded derivatives compare to MS's involvement in CLNs structured as hybrid instruments with embedded derivatives, given the shared exposure to credit event risks in structured notes?",
      "answer": "BAC reports that its net gains (losses) in market-making activities relate to embedded derivatives in structured liabilities and are typically offset by gains (losses) on derivatives and securities used to hedge these liabilities. MS, on the other hand, structures CLNs as hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, where the Firm sells credit protection and faces risk of principal loss upon a credit event in the reference entity. Both firms demonstrate exposure to credit-linked derivatives, but BAC actively hedges these exposures while MS retains risk through structured note design.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 Embedded Derivatives: BAC discloses that its market-making gains/losses relate to embedded derivatives in structured liabilities, which are typically offset by gains/losses on hedging derivatives and securities.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

For high credit quality CMBS, yields were recalculated using actual payments and updated prepayment expectations. In contrast, BAC's 2023 financial statements showed $42,469 million in commercial CMBS holdings carried at fair value with a 2.61% yield on the portion due after ten years, and $1,465 million in commercial CMBS with a 2.61% yield in the over-ten-years maturity category, indicating different valuation and reporting practices between the two institutions.",

      "question": "How does AIG's exposure to $156 million in office loans greater than 90 days delinquent compare to MET's strategy of purchasing reperforming loans that were previously delinquent, given the role of delinquent loans in generating reperforming loan pools?",
      "answer": "AIG reported a specific exposure of $156 million in office loans supporting the Fortitude Re funds that were greater than 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure as of December 31, 2022. These loans were ultimately foreclosed and reclassified into 'Other invested assets' by December 31, 2023. In contrast, MET actively purchases reperforming loans\u2014those that were previously delinquent but have returned to performing status\u2014as part of its residential mortgage loan portfolio strategy. The connection between these two strategies lies in the fact that delinquent loans, such as those held by AIG, can transition into reperforming loans when borrowers resume payments, which MET then acquires. This reflects a broader market dynamic where delinquent loans feed into the supply of reperforming loans, which are then priced and managed based on their historical delinquency and recovery performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 Delinquent Loans: AIG disclosed a $156 million exposure to office loans supporting Fortitude Re funds that were over 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure.",
        "Hop 2: Delinquent Loans \u2192 Reperforming Loans: Delinquent loans can transition into reperforming loans when borrowers resume payments, as noted in MET\u2019s investment criteria for residential mortgage-backed securities.",
        "Hop 3: Reperforming Loans \u2190 MET: MET actively purchases reperforming loans\u2014previously delinquent loans that have been performing for at least 12 months post-modification\u2014as part of its residential mortgage loan portfolio strategy."

      "question": "How does the implementation timeline for the Anti-Money Laundering Act's investment adviser provisions impact Goldman Sachs' compliance obligations, and how does this compare with Mastercard's ongoing obligations under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act given their respective business models?",
      "answer": "The implementation timeline for the Anti-Money Laundering Act's (AMLA) investment adviser provisions significantly impacts Goldman Sachs' compliance obligations, particularly with the January 1, 2026 effective date for rules that classify certain investment advisers as 'financial institutions' under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). This requires Goldman Sachs to implement minimum standards for AML/CFT programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN, as disclosed in their 2024 10-K filing. In contrast, Mastercard has already implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program under the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act, including policies and internal controls to prevent illicit activity on its payments network. While Goldman Sachs is adapting to new regulatory classifications and timelines, Mastercard's obligations under the BSA are mature and embedded in its global compliance framework, reflecting the differing regulatory expectations between investment advisers and payments processors.",

Federal consumer protection laws to which we  are  subject  include  the  G ramm-Leach-Bliley  Act's  privacy  provisions, Equal  Credit  Opportunity  Act,  Home  Mortgage  Disclosure  Act,  Electronic Fund  Transfer  Act, Fair Credit Reporting  Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, all of which are  enforced by the  CFPB.  We are also subject to certain federal consumer protection  laws  enforced  by  the  OCC,  including  the  Servicemembers  Civil Relief Act. Furthermore, we are subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials  are  empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a range of our activities.\n\n## Non-U.S. Regulation\n\nOur  businesses  are  regulated  ex tensively  by  non-U.S.  regulators,  including governments,  central  banks  and  regulatory  bodies,  securities  exchanges, commodity exchanges, and self-regulatory organizations, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. Certain regulators  have prudential, business conduct and other authority over us or our subsidiaries, as well as powers to limit or restrict us from engaging in certain businesses or to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censures, fines, asset seizures  and  forfeitures,  the  issuance  of  cease-and-desist  orders,  or  the suspension or expulsion of a regulated entity, its affiliates or its employees. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to capital, liquidity, leverage and other prudential requirements that are applicable under non-U.S. law.\n\n## Firmwide Financial Crimes Program\n\nOur Financial Crimes program  is coordinated  and  implemented  on  an enterprise-wide  basis  and  supports  our  financial  crime  prevention  efforts across  all  regions  and  business  units.  The  program  includes  anti-money laundering  ('AML'),  economic  sanctions  ('Sanctions'),  anti-boycott,  anticorruption, anti-tax evasion, and government and political activities compliance programs and aligned business-line risk functions.\n\nIn the U.S., the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001  and  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Act  of  2020,  imposes  significant obligations on financial institutions to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing activity, including requiring banks, broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and mutual funds to develop and implement  AML  programs,  verify  the  identity  of  customers  that  maintain accounts, and\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\nmonitor  and  report  suspicious  activity  to  appropriate  law  enforcement  or regulatory authorities. Outside  of the U.S., applicable laws, rules  and regulations  similarly  require  designated  types  of  financial  institutions  to implement AML programs.\n\nWe are also subject to Sanctions, such as regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. government, including the U.S. Treasury Department's  Office  of  Foreign  Assets  Control  ('OFAC')  and  the  U.S. Department  of  State,  and  similar  sanctions  programs  imposed  by  foreign governments or global or regional multilateral organizations. In addition, we are subject to anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering,  promising,  giving  or  authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.\n\n## Cyber and Information Security Risk Management and Protection of Client Information\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  faces  increased  global  regulatory  focus regarding  cyber  and  information  security  risk  management  practices.  Many aspects of our businesses are subject to cybersecurity legal, regulatory and disclosure requirements enacted by U.S. federal and state governments and other  non-U.S.  jurisdictions.  These  requirements  are  generally  aimed  at codifying basic cybersecurity protections and mandating data breach notification requirements.\n\nOur  businesses  are  also  subject  to  increasing  privacy  and  data  protection legal  requirements  concerning  the  use  and  protection  of  certain  personal information with regard to clients, employees and others. These requirements impose mandatory privacy and data protection obligations, including providing  for  individual  rights,  enhanced  governance  and  accountability requirements,  and  significant  fines  and  litigation  risk  for  noncompliance.  In addition, several jurisdictions have enacted or proposed personal and other data  localization  requirements  and  restrictions  on  cross-border  transfer  of personal and other data that may restrict our ability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional financial and regulatory burdens to do so.\n\nNumerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and regulations in these areas and  many  are  considering  new  or  updated  ones  that  could  impact  our businesses, particularly as the application, interpretation and enforcement of these  laws,  rules  and  regulations  are  often  uncertain  and  evolving.  Many aspects of our businesses are subject to legal requirements concerning the use and protection of certain customer and other information, as well as the privacy and cybersecurity laws referenced above. We have adopted measures designed  to  comply  with  these  and  related  applicable  requirements  in  all relevant jurisdictions.",

Through  these  and  other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may  be involved in terrorism,  money laundering or other suspicious activities.\n\nThe AMLA was intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money  laundering  laws.  Among  other  things,  the  AMLA  codifies  a risk-based  approach  to  anti-money  laundering  compliance  for  financial institutions;  requires  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  to  periodically promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA  compliance;  expands enforcementand investigation-related authority,  including  a  significant  expansion  in  the  available  sanctions  for certain  BSA  violations;  and  expands  BSA  whistleblower  incentives  and protections. Certain statutory provisions in the AMLA require rulemakings beyond those that have already been finalized, reports and other measures. The  impact  of  the  AMLA  will  depend  on,  among  other  things,  these additional rulemakings and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network  (FinCEN),  a  bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of Treasury, has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering  the  financing  of  terrorism,  as  required  under  the AMLA.  The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking organization activity, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\n24 Goldm an Sachs 2024 Form  10-K\n\nThe  Corporate  Transparency Act (CTA) was enacted in 2021 as part of the  AMLA  and  designed  to  establish  beneficial  ownership  information reporting requirements for certain types of entities, and in 2024, FinCEN's rule implementing the reporting requirements of the CTA  became effective. Under the rule, domestic companies formed before 2024 would be  required  to  file  their  initial  report  by  January  1,  2025  and  domestic companies  formed  in  or  after  2024  would  be  required  to  file  their  initial report within, respectively, 90 or 30 days of their formation, in each case subject to certain exemptions. On February 19, 2025, FinCEN announced that the earliest initial reporting deadline is March 21, 2025.\n\nIn 2024, FinCEN and the SEC proposed a rule that would require certain investment  advisers  to  implement  reasonable  procedures  to  identify  and verify  the  identities  of  their  customers.  In  2024,  FinCEN  proposed  to amend  the  anti-money  laundering/countering  the  financing  of  terrorism (AML/CFT) program requirements for all financial  institutions  subject  to the  BSA  that  have  AML/CFT  program  obligations,  including  us.  The proposal  would,  among  other  things,  require  a  financial  institution's  risk assessment  process  to  identify,  evaluate  and  document  the  financial institution's  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  illicit  activity risks, and update such risk assessments on a periodic basis. In 2024, the U.S.  federal  bank  regulatory  agencies  proposed  amendments  to  their respective  BSA  program  rules  to  align  those  rules  with  the  FinCEN proposal.  FinCEN has also adopted a rule, effective on  January 1, 2026, that  includes  certain  investment  advisers,  such  as  us,  in  the  definition  of 'financial  institutions'  under  FinCEN's  rules  implementing  the  BSA  and, among other things, prescribes minimum standards for  AML/CFT programs to be established by such investment advisers and requires them to report suspicious activity to FinCEN.\n\nWe are  subject  to  other  laws  and  regulations  worldwide  relating  to  antimoney  laundering  and  financial  transparency,  including  the  E.U.  AntiMoney  Laundering  Directives.  In  addition,  we  are  subject  to  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  the  U.K.  Bribery  Act  and  other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing  anything  of  value,  for  the  benefit  of  government  officials  and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification  of  clients,  monitoring  for  and  reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.",

We  have i mplemented a comprehensive  AML/CFT program, comprised of policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls,  including  the  designaEon  of  a  compliance  officer, which is  designed  to  prevent  our  payments  network  from  being  used  to  facilitate  money  laundering  and  other  illicit  acEvity  and  to  address  these  legal  and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

In the U.S., these obligaEons include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against  OFAC sancEons lists (including the  SDN  List).

      "question": "How does the exposure of MS to U.K. sovereign obligations interact with the U.K.'s implementation of resolution regimes, and how does this compare to GS's experience under similar resolution frameworks in terms of intercompany funding subordination risk?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley holds significant trading assets in U.K. sovereign obligations, exposing it to concentration risk. The U.K., as a jurisdiction, has implemented resolution regimes that include bail-in powers, allowing authorities to write down or convert unsecured liabilities into equity to recapitalize failing institutions. Goldman Sachs, which operates under similar resolution frameworks in the U.K., faces the risk that intercompany funding provided to its U.K. subsidiaries could be 'bailed in,' resulting in subordination of claims or write-downs, directly impacting Group Inc.'s recoverability on those claims. This creates a multi-hop risk chain where MS\u2019s exposure to U.K. sovereign debt is indirectly linked to the regulatory risk posed by resolution regimes that both firms must navigate, with GS explicitly experiencing the contractual and financial consequences of such bail-in mechanisms.",

The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to certain supported subsidiaries,  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  secured  amended  and  restated support agreement.\n\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and of the Funding IHC, respectively, under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain other assets), and the assets of  the  Funding  IHC,  as  applicable. As  a  result,  claims  of  certain  supported subsidiaries,  including  the  Funding  IHC,  against  the  assets  of  the  Parent Company  with  respect  to  such  secured  assets  are  effectively  senior  to unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.\n\nAlthough an SPOE strategy, whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or  in  a  resolution  proceeding  under  the  orderly  liquidation  authority,  is intended  to  result  in  better  outcomes  for  creditors  overall,  there  is  no guarantee that the application of an SPOE strategy, including the provision of support  to  the  Parent  Company's  supported  subsidiaries  pursuant  to  the secured amended and restated support agreement, will not result in greater losses  for  holders  of  our  securities  compared  with  a  different  resolution strategy for us.\n\nRegulators  have  taken  and  proposed  various  actions  to  facilitate  an  SPOE strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the orderly liquidation authority and other  resolution  regimes.  For  ex ample,  the  Federal  Reserve  requires  top-tier BHCs  of  U.S.  G -SIBs,  including  the  Firm,  to  maintain  adequate  TLAC, including  equity  and  eligible  long-term  debt,  in  order  to  ensure  that  such institutions have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized  through  the  conversion  of  debt  to  equity  or  otherwise  by imposing  losses  on  eligible  TLAC  where  the  SPOE  strategy  is  used.  The combined  implication of the SPOE  resolution  strategy  and  the  TLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible longterm debt and other forms of eligible  TLAC issued by the  Parent  Company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our supported subsidiaries without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.K.  and  E.U.  jurisdictions, have  implemented  changes  to  resolution  regimes  to  provide  resolution authorities  with  the  ability  to  recapitalize  a  failing  entity  organized  in  such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity. Such 'bail-in' powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors. This may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis and may result in limitations on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, including in times of stress. Non-U.S. regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\namounts  of  TLAC  that  would  pass  losses  up  from  the  subsidiaries  to  the Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the Parent Company in the event of failure.\n\n## We may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital requirements.\n\nWe are  subject  to  comprehensive  consolidated  supervision,  regulation  and examination  by  the  Federal  Reserve,  including  with  respect  to  regulatory capital  requirements,  stress  testing  and  capital  planning.  We  submit,  on  at least  an  annual  basis,  a  capital  plan  to  the  Federal  Reserve  describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take.  Our  ability  to  take  capital  actions  described  in  the  capital  plan  is dependent  on,  among  other  factors,  the  results  of  supervisory  stress  tests conducted by the Federal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory capital requirements to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our  operating  ex penses  or  constrain  our  ability  to  take  capital  actions.  For additional  information,  see  'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.'\n\n## The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement investigations, and we may face damage to our reputation and legal liability.\n\nAs  a  global  financial  services  firm,  we  face  the  risk  of  investigations  and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in all countries  in  which  we  conduct  our  business.  These  investigations  and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, continue to impact the financial services industry. Certain U.S. and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against, or have sought criminal convictions, pleas, deferred prosecution agreements or nonprosecution  agreements  from  financial  institutions.  Significant  regulatory  or law  enforcement  action  against  us  could  materially  adversely  affect  our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations, and increase our exposure to civil litigation.\n\nInvestigations  and  proceedings  initiated  by  these  authorities  may  result  in adverse  judgments,  settlements,  fines,  penalties,  disgorgement,  restitution, forfeiture, injunctions or other relief, and have included and may in the future include requirements that the Firm admit certain conduct, which may result in increased exposure to civil litigation. In addition, these measures have caused and  may  in  the  future  cause  collateral  consequences.  For  ex ample,  such matters could impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on, certain of our businesses.",

          "chunk_text": "In  addition,  certain  jurisdictions,  including  the  U.K.  and  the  E.U.,  have implemented resolution  regimes  to  provide  resolution  authorities  with  the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting  its  unsecured  debt  into  equity.  Such  'bail-in'  powers  are intended  to  enable  the  recapitalization  of  a  failing  institution  by  allocating losses  to  its  shareholders  and  unsecured  debtholders.  For  example,  the Bank of  England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we  provide  to  our  material  U.K.  subsidiaries  to  contain  a  contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such 'bail-in' powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to  our  subsidiaries  is  'bailed  in,'  Group  Inc.'s  claims  on  its  subsidiaries would  be  subordinated  to  the  claims  of  the  subsidiaries'  third-party creditors  or  written  down.  U.S.  regulators  are  considering  and  non-U.S. authorities  have  adopted  requirements  that  certain  subsidiaries  of  large financial  institutions  maintain  minimum  amounts  of  total  loss-absorbing capacity  that  would  pass  losses  up  from  the  subsidiaries  to  the  top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.\n\n## The application of Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater los s es  for Group Inc.'s  s ecurity holders .\n\nIn  our  resolution  plan,  Group  Inc.  would  be  resolved  under  the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of  the  single  point  of  entry  strategy:  Group  Inc.  and  Goldman  Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including  through  the  forgiveness  of  intercompany  indebtedness,  the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful,  creditors  of  some  or  all  of  Group  Inc.'s  major  subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.'s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\n\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In  exchange  for  an  unsecured  subordinated  funding  note  and  equity interest,  Group  Inc.  transferred  certain  intercompany  receivables  and substantially  all  of  its  GCLA  to  Funding  IHC,  and  agreed  to  transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\n\nWe also  put  in  place  a  Capital  and  Liquidity  Support Agreement  (CLSA) among  Group  Inc.,  Funding  IHC  and  our  major  subsidiaries.  Under  the CLSA,  Funding  IHC  has  provided  Group  Inc.  with  a  committed  line  of credit  that  allows  Group  Inc.  to  draw  sufficient  funds  to  meet  its  cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed  line  of  credit  will  automatically  terminate  and  the  unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany  receivables  owed  by  the  major  subsidiaries  to  Group  Inc. will  be  transferred to  Funding  IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its  remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to  fund  anticipated  bankruptcy  expenses)  to  Funding  IHC,  and  (iv) Funding  IHC  will  be  obligated  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.'s and Funding IHC's obligations under the  CLSA  are  secured  pursuant  to  a  related  security  agreement.  Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.'s liquidity. As a result,  during  a  period  of  severe  stress,  Group  Inc.  might  commence bankruptcy  proceedings  at  an  earlier  time  than  it  otherwise  would  if  the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\n\nIf  Group  Inc.'s  proposed  resolution  strategy  were  successful,  Group Inc.'s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group  Inc.'s  major  subsidiaries  would  incur  no  losses  because  those subsidiaries would  continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy  proceedings. As  part  of  the  strategy,  Group  Inc.  could  also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries' derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols,  as  applicable,  which  would  result  in  holders  of  Group  Inc.'s eligible  long-term  debt  and  holders  of  Group  Inc.'s  other  debt  securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and other  debt  securities  could  incur  losses  ahead  of  other  similarly  situated creditors of Group Inc.'s major subsidiaries.\n\nIf  Group Inc.'s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.'s  financial  condition  would  be  adversely  impacted  and  Group  Inc.'s security  holders,  including  debtholders,  may  as  a  consequence  be  in  a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any  payments  to  debtholders  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  make  such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.",

      "answer": "Capital One reported total delinquent loans of $623 million as of December 31, 2023, which contributes to the pool of potentially reperforming loans. MetLife purchases reperforming loans that have returned to performing status after being delinquent for at least 12 months. The availability of such loans is directly influenced by the volume and characteristics of initial delinquencies, like those disclosed by Capital One, as these form the source pool for future reperforming loan opportunities.",

        "Hop 2: Delinquent Loans \u2192 Reperforming Loans: Delinquent loans are a prerequisite for reperforming loans, as the latter refers to loans that were previously delinquent but have resumed performing status, as noted in MetLife's investment criteria.",
        "Hop 3: Reperforming Loans \u2190 MET: MetLife actively purchases reperforming loans that have been performing for at least 12 months post-modification, incorporating them into its residential mortgage loan portfolio with specific risk and loss estimation frameworks."

      "answer": "BlackRock uses NAV as a practical expedient to value certain investments that lack a readily determinable fair value and have attributes of an investment company, as disclosed in its 2024 10-K filing. Similarly, JPMorgan applies NAV as a practical expedient for $1.0 billion in private equity fund holdings, which are reported in other assets. According to the UPS 2024 10-K filing, investments like private equity funds are typically valued using NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, adjusted for investment activity through year-end. This reveals that both firms align with a consistent NAV-based valuation methodology for private equity funds, though each applies it independently to their respective portfolios.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a NAV or its equivalent developed consistent with ASC measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two- to three-month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2024.\n- Real Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds: Plan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provisions exist for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between 10 and 15 years from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $2.7 billion are ex pected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between three and six years.",

      "answer": "Under the PCA Framework updated by Basel III, Bank of America must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% to be considered 'well capitalized,' which includes a 2.5% capital conservation buffer. Capital One, as a Category III institution under Basel III, is required to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, but must also comply with additional buffer requirements such as the capital conservation buffer. The PCA Framework's higher CET1 threshold for being 'well capitalized' imposes a stricter capital adequacy standard on Bank of America compared to Capital One's baseline regulatory minimums.",

        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 PCA Framework: Bank of America must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more to be considered 'well capitalized' under the PCA framework as updated by Basel III.",

        "Hop 3: Basel III Capital Rules \u2190 COF: Capital One, as a Category III institution, is subject to a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% under Basel III, with additional buffer requirements applying depending on regulatory classification."

      "question": "How does the deterioration in BAC's commercial real estate credit quality, particularly in office properties, influence MET's use of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method and its annual updates to unpaid claims assumptions for Protection Life and Health products?",
      "answer": "BAC experienced a deterioration in commercial credit quality during 2023, especially in the commercial real estate office property type, due to stagnant office space demand and evolving employment models (BAC chunk). MET updates its unpaid claims assumptions annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience, including macroeconomic conditions (MET chunk). MET uses the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method to estimate unpaid claims for Protection Life and Health products, relying on historical claims data and expected loss ratios, which are sensitive to economic shifts (Hop2 chunk). Therefore, a worsening macroeconomic environment\u2014such as declining commercial real estate values and increased defaults in office properties\u2014could affect MET\u2019s claims estimation by altering expected loss ratios, particularly for long-duration Protection Health claims or experience-rated contracts where adverse claim experience is passed to sponsors (MET chunk). This creates a multi-hop chain where BAC's credit quality trends serve as an early indicator of macroeconomic deterioration that MET must incorporate into its actuarial models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Fair Value\n\n## Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\n\nA significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate. We make estimates  regarding  the  valuation  of  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair value  in  preparing  the  financial  statements.  These  assets  and  liabilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Trading assets and Trading liabilities;\n- Investment Securities-AFS;\n- Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;\n- Loans held-for-sale (measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value);\n- Certain Deposits, primarily certificates of deposit;\n- Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;\n- Certain Other secured financings; and\n- Certain Borrowings.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer  a  liability  (i.e.,  the  ex it  price)  in  an  orderly  transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs, and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring  that  the  relevant  observable  inputs  be  used  when  available.  The hierarchy is broken down into three levels: wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and  Level  3  consists  of  valuation  techniques  that  incorporate  significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. The fair  values  for  the  substantial  majority  of  our  financial  assets  and  liabilities carried  at  fair  value  are  based  on  observable  prices  and  inputs  and  are classified in level 1 or 2, of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 financial assets represented 0.9% and 1.2% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs, as well as market liquidity, may be reduced for many instruments, which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the  valuation  of  many  instruments  carried  at  fair  value.  Imprecision  in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of  gain  or  loss  recorded  for  a  particular  position.  The  Firm  uses  various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the  Firm could result  in  a  different  estimate  of  fair  value  at  the  reporting  date.  For  further information on the\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\ndefinition  of  fair  value,  Level  1,  Level  2,  Level  3  and  related  valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  valuation  adjustments  are  made  to  account  for  various factors,  such  as  liquidity  risk  (bid-ask  adjustments),  credit  quality,  model uncertainty, concentration risk and funding, in order to arrive at fair value. For a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the financial statements.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments, including, in  part,  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  that  are  subject  to  uncertainty. Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments. G oodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to  a  reporting  unit. As  such,  all  the  activities  of  a  reporting  unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to either (i) perform a quantitative  impairment  test  or  (ii)  first  perform  a  qualitative  assessment  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative test would be performed.\n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the  reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  goodwill  impairment loss is equal to the ex cess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use  for  each  of  the  reporting  units.  The  estimated  fair  value  is  generally determined  by  utilizing  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology.  In  certain instances,  we  may  also  utilize  methodologies  that  incorporate  price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of comparable companies.\n\nThe  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  uses  projected  future  cash  flows based  on  the  reporting  units'  earnings  forecast.  The  discount  rate  used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model.",

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase Bank's role as successor trustee in Citigroup's 2005 Senior Debt Indenture compare to its provision of administrative services in Morgan Stanley's wealth management operations, particularly regarding the nature of their financial oversight responsibilities?",
      "answer": "In Citigroup's 2005 Senior Debt Indenture (filed March 13, 2006), JPMorgan Chase Bank served as successor trustee, overseeing debt securities issuance and ensuring compliance with indenture terms for Citigroup Funding Inc. and Citigroup Inc. In contrast, Morgan Stanley's wealth management operations include administrative services that involve client asset management, custody, and stock plan administration, indicating a more operational and client-facing role. While both involve oversight, JPMorgan's role is specifically tied to debt instrument governance, whereas Morgan Stanley's administrative services support broader wealth management functions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: Citigroup (C) \u2192 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: Citigroup's 2005 Senior Debt Indenture identifies JPMorgan Chase Bank as successor trustee, indicating responsibility for debt securities compliance and governance.",
        "Hop 2: JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \u2192 Administrative Services: JPMorgan provides administrative services as evidenced by its role as Administrative Agent in The Home Depot's 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, demonstrating its involvement in financial oversight functions.",
        "Hop 3: Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2190 Administrative Services: Morgan Stanley's wealth management operations include administrative services covering client asset management, custody, and stock plan administration, showing a different application of similar oversight capabilities."

Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts\n\nOur foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of 18 months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Level 3 Inputs\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liability\n\nIn connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR G mbH ('MYR'), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to \u20ac300 million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA') approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.\n\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:\n\n",

Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting v aluation estimate.\n- Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair v alue in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm's own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.\n\n## Valuation model review and approval\n\nIf prices or quotes are not av ailable for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair v alue is generally determined using v aluation models that consider relev ant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price v erification process described abov e is applied to the inputs in those models.\n\nUnder the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR rev iews and approv es new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating env ironment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to rev iew or approv al. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activ ity.\n\n182\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nA three-lev el fair v alue hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair v alue measurements. The fair v alue hierarchy is based on the observ ability of inputs to the v aluation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three lev els are defined as follows.\n\n- Level 1 - inputs to the v aluation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in activ e markets.\n- Level 2 - inputs to the v aluation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in activ e markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n- Level 3 - one or more inputs to the v aluation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair v alue measurement.\n\nA financial instrument's categorization within the fair v alue hierarchy is based on the lowest lev el of input that is significant to the fair v alue measurement.",

      "question": "How does the structure of AIGLH's junior subordinated debentures, which were originally issued through a trust, compare to MetLife's use of a trust to support MRC's closed block liabilities, particularly in terms of asset backing and regulatory dependencies?",
      "answer": "AIGLH issued junior subordinated debentures through a trust in 1996, which were later distributed directly to holders in 2013 after the trusts were dissolved. As of December 31, 2021, $227 million in debentures (comprising $54 million at 8.5%, $142 million at 8.125%, and $31 million at 7.57%) remained outstanding and were guaranteed by AIG Parent. In contrast, MetLife used a trust to hold proceeds from MRC's $2.5 billion surplus notes issued in 2007, which were tied to statutory reserve support for closed block liabilities. MRC made transfers to and from the trust based on statutory needs, with $78 million added in 2021 and $78 million withdrawn in 2020, and the trust's assets were primarily invested in AFS fixed maturity securities. Unlike AIGLH\u2019s debentures, MetLife\u2019s trust structure involved regulatory dependencies for MRC\u2019s interest and principal payments, and MetLife, Inc. had an offsetting interest exchange agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution.",

In connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors placed by an unaffiliated financial institution, $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 35-year surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes accrues at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval.\n\nSimultaneously with the issuance of the surplus notes, MetLife, Inc. entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution,  under  which  MetLife,  Inc.  is  entitled  to  the  interest  paid  by  MRC  on  the  surplus  notes  of  three-month  LIBOR  plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of three-month LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted, as described below. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments are accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and do not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such  payments,  however,  reduce  the  amount  of  interest  payments  due  from  MetLife,  Inc.  under  the  agreement. Any  payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution reduces the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and also increases the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. In addition, the unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge collateral to MetLife, Inc. related to any increase in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  following  regulatory  approval,  MRC  repurchased  $79  million, $148 million and $67 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes. Payments made by the Company in 2021, 2020 and 2019 associated with the repurchases were exclusive of accrued interest on the surplus notes. In connection with the repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company received payments in the aggregate amount of $10  million,  $20  million  and  $9  million,  respectively,  from  the  unaffiliated  financial  institution,  which  reduced  the  amount receivable from the unaffiliated financial institution by the same amounts. No other payments related to an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes were made by MetLife, Inc. or received from the unaffiliated financial institution for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n\nA majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the Company, to support MRC's statutory obligations associated with the assumed closed block liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, MRC transferred $78 million and $2 million, respectively, to the trust out of its general account. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MRC transferred $78 million out of the trust to its general account. The assets are principally invested in fixed maturity  securities AFS  and  are  presented  as  such  within  the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets,  with  the  related  income included within net investment income on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.",

      "answer": "Bank of America's Series B Preferred Stock holders have general voting rights and vote together with common stockholders, while Visa's Series B Preferred Stock holders have severely limited voting rights, only participating in votes related to specific corporate events like mergers where their equity treatment would change. This creates a significant difference in shareholder influence despite both institutions having similar preferred stock frameworks. Bank of America's $1.6 billion annual dividend payments to preferred shareholders, combined with voting rights, gives these investors both financial return and governance influence, whereas Visa's preferred shareholders receive financial returns without commensurate governance power. This structural difference could affect how preferred shareholders in each company engage with corporate strategy and risk management decisions.",

      "question": "How does Visa's issuance of 99,264 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in July 2024, which automatically convert into Class A Common Stock, compare to Capital One's preferred stock disclosures in terms of capital structure flexibility and risk allocation?",
      "answer": "Visa issued 99,264 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in July 2024 as part of its mechanism to manage VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the conversion rate of preferred stock, which ultimately convert into Class A Common Stock. This provides Visa with a dynamic capital structure tool to absorb litigation-related losses without directly impacting net income, as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock exceeds the covered loss. In contrast, Capital One\u2019s 2024 disclosures show outstanding preferred stock without a stated conversion mechanism into common stock, indicating a more static capital structure with less direct alignment to risk absorption or equity conversion flexibility. Visa\u2019s structure enables risk reallocation via equity adjustments, while Capital One\u2019s appears to serve a more traditional preferred equity role.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 Series A Preferred Stock: Capital One discloses preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024, but does not indicate any conversion mechanism into common stock, suggesting a static capital structure.",
        "Hop 2: Series A Preferred Stock \u2192 Class A Common Stock: Visa\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock automatically converts into 100 shares of Class A Common Stock upon eligible sale, linking preferred equity directly to common equity and enabling dynamic risk absorption through conversion adjustments.",
        "Hop 3: Class A Common Stock \u2190 V: Visa issued 99,264 new Series A Preferred Stock shares in July 2024, which are tied to the company\u2019s litigation risk management strategy and ultimately convert into Class A Common Stock, demonstrating a structured mechanism for risk allocation."

T he  Company has entered into a litigation management deed with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory cov ered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory cov ered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conv ersion or reduction in the conv ersion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). T he litigation management deed provides  that  the  Company  will  generally  control  the  conduct  of  the  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  subject  to  certain  obligations  to  report  and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory cov ered litigation (VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee). The VE T erritory Litigation  Management Committee, which is composed of representativ es of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory cov ered litigation.\n\nThe  Company  obtained  certain  protections  for  VE  territory  cov ered  losses  through  the  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  the  UK  loss  sharing agreement and the litigation management deed (collectiv ely Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan). T he plan cov ers VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates, where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. T he plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law  enforcement  proceedings,  only  the  interchange  litigation  specifically  cov ered  by  the  plan's terms.\n\nUnlike the U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan, the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan does not hav e an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recov er VE territory cov ered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection av ailable through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan is equiv alent to the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conv ersion rate applicable to each series of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the v alue of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The book v alue of the preferred stock reflects its historical v alue recorded at the Closing less VE territory cov ered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conv ersion rate. T he book v alue does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory cov ered losses as long as the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory cov ered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders' equity in the contra-equity account right to recov er for cov ered losses, which represents the Company's right to recov er such losses through adjustments to the conv ersion rate applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nVE territory cov ered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conv ersion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, indiv idual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conv ersion rate is made, the amount prev iously recorded in right to recov er for cov ered losses is then recorded against the book v alue of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2024, the eighth anniv ersary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee, carried out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $2.7 billion of the as-conv erted v alue from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024 (Eighth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock receiv ed a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment div ided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically conv erted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.",

      "answer": "The adoption of ASU 2022-02 eliminated the TDR framework and introduced FDMs, changing how Capital One reports loan modifications. Capital One noted that the types of modifications offered\u2014such as interest rate reductions, term extensions, and principal reductions\u2014remained the same, but they are now categorized and reported differently under FDMs. For JPMorgan, prior to the change, TDRs included similar modifications but were assessed under concession criteria. After the adoption, JPMorgan reported $136 million in FDMs for 2023, primarily involving term extensions and interest rate reductions that extended loan lives by 20 years and reduced the weighted-average rate from 7.21% to 4.44%. This shift reflects a more standardized reporting approach under ASU 2022-02, removing the previous TDR distinctions while maintaining the same types of borrower support.",

      "answer": "Both Citigroup and Bank of America (BAC) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed payments on trust preferred securities issued by their finance subsidiaries\u2014Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII in Citigroup\u2019s case, and unspecified Trusts in BAC\u2019s case. However, BAC explicitly notes that its obligations under these guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, meaning claimants can only look to BAC\u2019s direct assets for payment. Citigroup\u2019s filing echoes this subordination risk, stating that no other subsidiaries guarantee the trust preferred securities. This parallel structure exposes both institutions to similar credit risk limitations, where a lack of available funds at the parent company level could restrict recovery for holders of guaranteed securities in bankruptcy or resolution scenarios.",

This guarantee, together with the Corporation's other obligations with respect to the T rust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trusts' payment obligations on the T rust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as applicable. No other subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA  Finance  and  each  of  the  T rusts  are  finance  subsidiaries,  have  no independent assets, revenues or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation  and/or  the  Corporation's  other  subsidiaries  to  meet  their  respective obligations under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be limited to those  available  under  the  applicable  guarantee  by  the  Corporation,  as  described above.\n\nThe Corporation is  a  holding  company  and  depends  upon  its  subsidiaries  for liq uid ity .

In addition, the  obligations  of  the  Corporation  under  the  guarantees  of  the  Guaranteed Securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries,  and  claimants  should  look  only  to  assets  of  the  Corporation  for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially  all  of  its  assets  to  one  or  more  d irect  or  ind irect  majority-owned subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to assume the Corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.\n\nFor  more  information  on  factors  that  may  affect  payments  to  holders  of  the Guaranteed Securities, see Liquidity Risk - NB Holdings Corporation in this section, Item 1. Business - Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority on page 6 and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Liquidity on page 9.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations\n\nFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty  to  meet  its  obligations.  Credit  risk  can  also  arise  from  operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising  from  all  product  classifications  including  loans  and  leases,  deposit overdrafts,  derivatives,  assets  held-for-sale  and  unfunded  lending  commitments, which  include  loan  commitments,  letters  of  credit  and  financial  guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or th e lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair  value  option.  Cred it  risk  for  ca tegories  of  a ssets  carried   a t  fa ir  va lue  is  not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments  recorded  in  earnings.  For  derivative  positions,  our  credit  risk  is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current  fair  value  to  represent  credit  exposure  without  giving  consideration  to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer  and  commercial  credit  extension  and  review  procedures  encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note  3 -Derivatives  and  Note  12  Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty , repayment  sources,  the  nature  of  underlying  collateral  and  other  support  given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and  enhance  customer  support  in  our  consumer  businesses,  we  have  in  place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures.  We  utilize  a  number  of  actions  to  mitigate  losses  in  the commercial  businesses  including  increasing  the  frequency  and  intensity  of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of  deteriorating  commercial  exposures  to  independent  special  asset  officers  as credits enter criticized categories.\n\nFor  information  on  our  credit  risk  management  activities,  see  the  following: Consumer  Portfolio  Credit  Risk  Management  on  page  59,  Commercial  Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 63, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 69, Allowance for Credit  Losses  on  page  72  and Note  5  -  Outstanding  Loans  and  Leases  and Allowance  for  Credit  Losses to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  For information  on  the  Corporation's  loan  modification  programs,  see Note  1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and  Leases  and  Allowance  for  Credit  Losses to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. For more information on the Corporation's credit risks, see the Credit section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDuring 202 4, our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans  and  the  commercial  real  estate  office  portfolio.  Commercial  reservable criticized  exposure  increased  compared  to  December  3 1,  2023  driven  by  an increase across a broad range of industries. Nonperforming loans also increased compared to December 3 1, 2023 primarily driven by the U.S. commercial portfolio. Uncertainty  remains  regarding  broader  economic  impacts  due  to  higher  costs associated  with  inflationary  pressures  experienced  over  the  past  several  years, elevated rates as well as the current geopolitical environment, and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.",

MET, under the same Dodd-Frank derivatives regulation, faces increased costs from OTC derivatives clearing and reporting requirements, and is exposed to default risks from clearing members or clearinghouses.

These rules also limit the ability of a broker-dealer to transfer capital to its parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public and private offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.\n\n## Climate-related Developments\n\nClimate change and the risks it may pose to financial institutions is an area of increased focus by the federal and state legislative bodies and regulators, including the Federal Banking Agencies. In the future, new regulations or guidance may be issued, or other regulatory or supervisory actions may be taken, in this area by the Federal Banking Agencies or other regulatory agencies, or new statutory requirements may be adopted. For example, the Federal Banking Agencies have issued principles for climate-related financial risk management, which are designed to support the identification and management of climate-related financial risks at regulated institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. For more information, please see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our businesses, operations and customers and result in increased costs. '\n\n## Regulation by Authorities Outside the United States\n\nThe Bank is subject to laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where it operates, primarily in the U.K. and Canada. In the U.K., the Bank operates through COEP, an authorized payment institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). COEP's parent, Capital One G lobal Corporation, is wholly owned by the Bank and is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as an 'agreement corporation' under the Federal Reserve's Regulation K. COEP does not take deposits. In Canada, the Bank operates as an authorized foreign bank and is permitted to conduct its credit card business in Canada through its Canadian branch, Capital One Bank (Canada Branch) ('Capital One Canada'). Capital One Canada does not take deposits. The primary regulators of Capital One Canada are the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions ('OSFI') and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada ('FCAC').\n\nThe foreign legal and regulatory requirements to which the Company's non-U.S. operation are subject include, among others, those related to consumer protection, business practices and limits on interchange fees. For more information on foreign regulatory activity concerning interchange fees, please see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by legislation, regulation and merchants' efforts to reduce the interchange fees charged by credit and debit card networks to facilitate card transactions. '\n\nWe also are, or may become, subject to continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security. For example, in Canada we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ('PIPEDA') as well as the provincial privacy laws, and may become subject to additional privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations in Canada, including those which may differ from PIPEDA and the provincial privacy laws, if passed. We also are subject to the U.K. G eneral Data Protection Regulation ('U.K. GDPR'). In addition, subject to limited exceptions, the European Union ('EU') G eneral Data Protection Regulation ('EU GDPR') applies EU data protection laws to certain companies processing personal data of individuals in the European Economic Area, regardless of the company's location. These laws and regulations, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, impose strict requirements regarding the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security and other processing of personal information, which may have adverse consequences, including significant compliance costs and severe monetary penalties for non-compliance. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements.

In New Y ork, the NYDFS expects both New Y ork domestic insurers, such as MLIC, and foreign authorized insurers, such as our other insurance subsidiaries licensed in New Y ork, to manage material climate risks by taking actions that are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their businesses. However, the NYDFS issued separate guidance for New Y ork domestic insurers, which contains more detailed expectations, such as (i) ensuring the board of directors understands relevant climate risks; (ii) performing regular reviews of the insurer's procedures that are designed to manage climate risks;  (iii)  using  scenario  analysis  to  inform  the  insurer's  business  strategies  and  risk  assessment;  and  (iv)  incorporating  material  climate  risks  into  its  financial  risk management (e.g., ERM and ORSA). In addition, New Y ork's regulation governing ERM, which applies to New Y ork domestic and foreign authorized insurers, was amended to require an insurance group's ERM function to address climate change risk.\n\nThe NAIC has adopted a standard for insurance companies to report their climate-related risks as part of its annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which applies to insurers that meet the reporting threshold of $100 million in countrywide direct premium and are licensed in one of the participating jurisdictions. The new disclosure standard is consistent with the international Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' framework for reporting climate-related financial information.\n\nPursuant to its authority under Dodd-Frank, the FIO is also assessing how the insurance sector may mitigate climate risks and help achieve national climate-related goals.  In  2023,  the  FIO  released  a  report  which  urges  insurance  regulators  to  adopt  climate-related  risk-monitoring  guidance  in  order  to  enhance  their  regulation  and supervision of insurers.\n\nThe SEC is also focused on climate, and environmental, social and governance ('ESG ') risks and opportunities. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. In April 2024, following litigation  challenging  the  final  rules,  the  SEC  voluntarily  stayed  the  final  rules  pending  completion  of  judicial  review .  In  2022,  the  SEC  also  proposed  rules  requiring registered investment companies, business development companies, and registered and certain unregistered investment advisers to disclose in their fund prospectuses, annual reports and Form ADV information about how funds and advisers incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies.\n\nIn 2023, California adopted laws establishing climate disclosure and climate-related financial risk reporting requirements which apply to companies doing business in California that meet applicable revenue thresholds. Also in 2023, California adopted a law establishing disclosure requirements for entities operating within California that market, sell, purchase, or use voluntary carbon offsets, as well as those that make claims of achieving net zero emissions or carbon neutrality that operate within and make such claims within the state. MetLife is in compliance with such requirements.\n\nThe EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') requires in-scope companies to report on (i) how sustainability issues might create financial risks for the company; and (ii) the company's impacts on people and the environment. CSRD applies on a staggered basis to companies, over a multi-year period, with the first reports due in 2025 in respect of the 2024 financial year. MetLife's largest insurance subsidiary in Europe is in scope for this first phase.\n\n## Consumer Protection Laws\n\nAs part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB') to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. Consumer protection laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions may also affect us.\n\n## Derivatives Regulation and Clearing of Treasury Securities\n\nDodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives markets requiring clearing of certain  OTC derivative transactions and imposes additional costs, including reporting and margin requirements. Centralized clearing also exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions.",

      "answer": "AIG accounts for structured securities, including RMBS, by recalculating effective yields based on actual payments and updated prepayment expectations, adjusting amortized cost accordingly with a corresponding impact on net investment income. For non-high credit quality structured securities, AIG bases yields on expected cash flows that factor in credit losses and prepayments, and recognizes changes in expected cash flows through an allowance for credit losses. Meanwhile, BAC notes that a significant increase in default rates or loss severities would materially lower the fair value of RMBS long positions, while changes in prepayment speeds would have differential impacts depending on instrument seniority. This shows that while AIG focuses on yield and credit loss adjustments tied to expected cash flows, BAC emphasizes sensitivity to default and prepayment volatility in RMBS valuation.",

      "answer": "BlackRock discloses that its Separate Account Assets, which include equity securities, debt securities, money market funds, and derivatives, are legally segregated and not subject to general claims of creditors. These assets are held to fund individual and group pension contracts and are offset by equal and offsetting liabilities on BlackRock\u2019s consolidated statements of financial condition. AIG reports Separate Account Liabilities that directly reflect the contract holder's account balance in these assets, and they are required to be equal and offsetting to the total Separate Account Assets. Therefore, any changes in the valuation or composition of BlackRock's Separate Account Assets would directly influence AIG\u2019s liability reporting, as AIG must mirror these asset values in its liabilities to reflect the contract holders' beneficial interest.",

      "answer": "JPMorgan utilizes foreign currency derivatives as part of its risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, which are categorized under 'Other' or 'Risk Management Activities' in its balance sheet. Goldman Sachs also enters into foreign currency derivatives, among other derivative types, as part of its off-balance sheet arrangements, which are used for purposes such as securitizations, underwriting client transactions, and providing secondary market liquidity. Both firms use foreign currency derivatives for risk mitigation, but JPMorgan's application is specifically tied to mortgage-related exposures, while Goldman Sachs' use is broader and embedded within its off-balance sheet operations.",

Production rev enue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair v alue adjustments on mortgage loans heldfor-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. gov ernment agencies), and changes in the fair v alue of financial instruments measured under the fair v alue option. Net mortgage serv icing rev enue includes operating rev enue earned from serv icing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized ov er the period in which the serv ice is prov ided; changes in the fair v alue of MSRs; the impact of risk management activ ities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage serv icing. Net mortgage serv icing rev enue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair v alue adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. gov ernment agencies.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activ ities and MSRs.\n\nNet interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.\n\n## Card income\n\nThis rev enue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis ov er a 12month period.\n\nCertain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activ ity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs v aries based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activ ity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.\n\n## Credit card revenue sharing agreements\n\nThe Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners that grant the Firm exclusiv e rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit card programs and prov ide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activ ities and prov ide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account activ ity. T he terms of these agreements generally range from fiv e to ten years.\n\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners' marketing activ ities and loyalty program rewards prov ided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis ov er a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales v olumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned.\n\nThe following table presents the components of card income:\n\n",

In January 2025, a series of wildfires started in Los Angeles County that spread throughout the region. We are in ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders to assess the health and safety conditions  of  our  office  locations  and  the  well-being  of  our employees.

As  of  the  date  of  this filing,  the  wildfires  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  results  of operations.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  we  enter  into  various  types  of  offbalance  sheet  arrangements.  Our  involvement  in  these  arrangements  can take many different forms, including:\n\n- Purchasing  or  retaining  residual  and  other  interests  in  special  purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;\n- Holding  senior  and  subordinated  debt,  interests  in  limited  and  general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;\n- Entering  into  interest  rate,  foreign  currency,  equity,  commodity  and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and\n- Providing  guarantees,  indemnifications,  commitments,  letters  of  credit and representations and warranties.\n\nWe  enter  into  these  arrangements  for  a  variety  of  business  purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to  the  functioning  of  several  significant  investor  markets,  including  the mortgage-backed  and  other  asset-backed  securities  markets,  since  they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.\n\nWe also  enter  into  these  arrangements  to  underwrite  client  securitization transactions;  provide  secondary  market  liquidity;  make  investments  in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes.\n\nThe table below presents where information about our various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K.

      "answer": "MetLife purchases reperforming loans, which are loans that were previously delinquent but have returned to performing status. These loans carry an elevated risk of redefault, as evidenced by MetLife's application of higher loss rates for nonperforming loans. If such loans become delinquent again, they may trigger repurchase obligations for Bank of America, which holds the option to repurchase delinquent loans from securitization trusts to reduce servicing advances or perform modifications. Specifically, Bank of America had $1.3 billion in servicing advances on serviced loans at the end of 2023, and repurchasing delinquent loans could directly impact this figure. Thus, the performance of MetLife\u2019s reperforming loan portfolio indirectly affects Bank of America\u2019s financial obligations tied to loan repurchases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 Reperforming Loans: MetLife purchases reperforming loans, which are defined as previously delinquent loans that have returned to performing status, and applies higher estimated lifetime loss rates to these loans due to their risk profile.",
        "Hop 2: Reperforming Loans \u2192 Delinquent Loans: Reperforming loans carry a risk of becoming delinquent again, which is factored into MetLife\u2019s ACL calculations, indicating that these loans may revert to delinquency under adverse conditions.",
        "Hop 3: Delinquent Loans \u2190 BAC: Bank of America has the option to repurchase delinquent loans from securitization trusts, which affects its servicing advance obligations\u2014$1.3 billion at the end of 2023\u2014and could lead to increased balance sheet exposure if exercised."

      "answer": "MET holds $12,567 million in pass-through mortgage-backed securities, including $1,699 million in NQM and Alt-A loans categorized under non-agency RMBS, with $1,294 million in unrealized losses in 2024. These pass-through securities are directly secured by pools of mortgage loans, including lower-quality segments like NQM and Alt-A that carry elevated credit risk. AIG, meanwhile, faces liquidity risk from its mortgage and loan portfolio, particularly due to its holdings of less liquid assets like private equity, hedge funds, mortgage loans, and real estate. AIG explicitly warns that adverse market conditions or valuation volatility in these assets could lead to material losses if sold in stressed environments. Thus, while MET's exposure is more specifically defined and marked-to-market with known unrealized losses, AIG's risk lies in the uncertain valuation and potential illiquidity of its broader mortgage-linked investments, which could realize even greater losses under unfavorable market conditions.",

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

There also may be cases where, due to the financial environment or market conditions, normally active markets become inactive or less active, which can result in insufficient observable data. A s a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT\n\nAIG  Parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries.\n\nAs a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund operations, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet debt service obligations and meet the capital and liquidity needs of our subsidiaries. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. A ny inability by our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments in an amount sufficient to enable A IG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations or our business, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity.\n\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to A IG Parent in the future will depend on their earnings, capital levels, tax considerations, covenants contained in any financing or other agreements, applicable regulatory restrictions and rating agency requirements. In addition, such payments could be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. A dditionally, our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to meet their obligations or to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits and restrictions or changes in, or interpretations of, regulatory or rating agency standards.\n\nOur decision to pursue strategic changes or transactions in our business and operations may also subject our subsidiaries' dividend plans to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could make obtaining regulatory approvals for extraordinary distributions by our subsidiaries, if required, more difficult. We are also subject to certain other restrictions on our capital from time to time.\n\nIf our liquidity  is insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability  of credit, regulatory  actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity . It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. If A IG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary's financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to post collateral for our insurance company subsidiaries from time to time. We may be required to post additional collateral due to regulatory changes from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nFor additional information on our liquidity, see Part II, Item 7. M D&amp;A - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments.\n\nWe have a diversified investment portfolio. However, economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers, the inability of potential buyers to obtain financing on reasonable terms, volatility, credit spread changes, interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rates and/or declines in collateral v alues have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, the liquidity and value of our investments.\n\nWe have investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income structured and privately placed securities as well as investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans and real estate, that are less liquid than other investments. If it became necessary to sell such assets in a stressed market environment, the prices achieved in any sale may be lower than their carrying value, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

      "answer": "BAC invests in CDOs, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives where credit protection has been sold to the issuer. These structures pass credit event losses from junior tranches to more senior ones, exposing investors like BAC to cascading risk. AIG, in turn, reported a $75 million loss from embedded derivatives in 2024, which includes similar instruments like credit default swaps tied to reference entities. A credit event in the underlying reference entity would directly impact both BAC\u2019s CDO value and AIG\u2019s derivative exposure, linking their financial risks through the same type of structured credit mechanism.",

The  assets  are  transferred  into  a  trust  or  other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities.

The  Corporation's maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  but  also  potential  losses associated  with  off-balance  sheet  commitments,  such  as  unfunded  liquidity commitments  and  other  contractual  arrangements.  The  Corporation's  maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.\n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated  VIEs  at  December  3 1,  202 4  and  2023  in  situations  where  the Corporation has a loan or security interest and involvement with transferred assets or if th e Corporation otherwise has an additional interest in the VIE.

In addition, the Corporation also enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may utilize VIEs for activities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold collateral. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to these VIEs is the investment balances. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 - Securities or Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included in the following tables.\n\nThe Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2024, 2023 and",

      "answer": "The governance implications stem from a potential misalignment between equity compensation flexibility and voting control. MA's LTIP technically permits the issuance of Class B common stock, which carries conditional voting rights that activate during major corporate decisions (e.g., exiting the core payments business or amending the certificate of incorporation). However, despite this structural provision, no Class B shares have been authorized for actual issuance under the LTIP. This creates a theoretical governance risk: if MA were to issue Class B shares through the LTIP in the future, those shares could gain voting power under specific circumstances, potentially influencing strategic decisions. Yet, the lack of current authorization suggests MA has no immediate intent to enable this dynamic, limiting the immediate impact on governance but leaving open a structural possibility.",

      "question": "How does the adoption of ASU No. 2023-02, which permits the use of the proportional amortization method for tax equity investments, impact both MS's and COF's accounting strategies for tax credit structures, given the prior eligibility restrictions?",
      "answer": "ASU No. 2023-02 expands the eligibility for using the proportional amortization method beyond Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments, allowing both MS and COF to apply this method to a broader range of tax equity investments if certain criteria are met. MS is evaluating the impact of this update but notes it does not expect a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, COF adopted this guidance in Q1 2024 using a modified retrospective method and also expects no material impact. Both firms benefit from greater flexibility in accounting for tax credit structures, aligning their strategies with the updated standard.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 Proportional Amortization Method: MS introduced the proportional amortization method as part of its accounting updates, noting it allows amortization in proportion to income tax credits received and applies to various tax credit programs with separate policy elections.",
        "Hop 2: Proportional Amortization Method \u2192 ASU No. 2023-02: ASU No. 2023-02 permits entities to elect the proportional amortization method for tax equity investments across all tax credit programs, not just Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments, provided certain conditions are met.",
        "Hop 3: ASU No. 2023-02 \u2190 COF: COF adopted ASU No. 2023-02 in Q1 2024 using a modified retrospective method and stated that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, indicating alignment with the new accounting strategy."

      "answer": "MetLife has an in-force block of assumed variable annuity guarantees from a third party, which includes guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDBs) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWBs). These guarantees expose MetLife to market risks, particularly in volatile or declining equity markets, as the fair value of these guarantees is sensitive to changes in interest rates, equity indices, and policyholder behavior. These guarantees may become more costly than expected under adverse market conditions. Separately, BlackRock has contractual arrangements where it may involve a third party in providing services to customers, and it acts as the principal in these arrangements, recognizing revenue gross of related costs. The involvement of third parties in both MetLife\u2019s assumed guarantees and BlackRock\u2019s service delivery introduces indirect dependencies on external entities, amplifying the complexity and potential financial exposure under volatile market conditions that affect both insurance obligations and asset management services.",

Fraudulent activities, such as account takeover, identity theft (including stolen financial information), and counterparty malicious activities, represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers, as well as their payment partners. We provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. We believe that these programs, which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty non-performance, are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry. These programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers, who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described, and merchants, who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer.\n\nOur ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary, end-to-end payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our two-sided network, specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments. Our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having PayPal recognized as one of the world's most trusted payments brands.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe  global  payments  industry  is  highly  competitive,  continuously  changing,  highly  innovative,  and  increasingly  subject  to regulatory  scrutiny  and  oversight.  Many  of  the  areas  in  which  we  compete  evolve  rapidly  with  innovative  and  disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\n\nWe compete with a wide range of businesses. Some of our current and potential competitors are or may be larger than we are, have larger  customer  bases,  greater  brand  recognition,  longer  operating  histories,  a  dominant  or  more  secure  position,  broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors  are  or  may  be  smaller  or  younger  companies  that  may  be  more  agile  in  responding  quickly  to  regulatory  and technological changes.\n\nWe differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences  for  our  merchants,  demonstrate  that  they  may  achieve  incremental  sales  by  using  and  offering  our  services  to consumers, support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods, through the simplicity and  transparency  of  our  fee  structure,  and  our  seller  protection  programs.  In  addition,  we  differentiate  ourselves  to  consumers through  the  ability  to  use  our  products  and  services  across  multiple  commerce  channels,  including  e-commerce,  mobile,  and payments at the point of sale, and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying; our  customer  service,  dispute  resolution,  and  buyer  protection  programs;  and  our  ability  to  simplify  and  personalize  shopping experiences.  We  invest  resources  towards  improving  our  products  and  services,  offering  choice  in  payment  options,  providing excellent customer service, and building brands that merchants and consumers trust.\n\nOur business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments. We face competition from banks and financial institutions, which provide traditional payment methods (particularly credit cards and debit cards (collectively, 'payment cards'), electronic bank transfers, and credit), payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks, payment card processors, and 'card on file' services. We also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards, digital wallets and mobile payments solutions, credit, installment or other buy now pay later methods, real-time payment systems, P2P payments and money remittance services, card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale, virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. Our products and services  face  competition  from  all  forms  of  payments,  which  include  paper-based  payments  (primarily  cash  and  checks),  credit cards, debit cards, electronic bank transfers, credit, installment methods, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, contactless payments (including contactless cards, tokenized cards, Near Field Communication based solutions, and QR code-based solutions), and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.\n\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see 'Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the caption ' We face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry' for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.",

In  some  cases,  they  are  owned  by  financial  institutions  or  payment  processors. These networks typically focus on debit payment products, and may have strong local acceptance, and recognizable brands. Examples include STAR, NYCE, and Pulse in the U.S., Interac in Canada and eftpos in Australia.\n\nDigital Wallet Providers: They continue to expand payment capabilities in person and online for consumers and merchants. While digital wallets can help drive Visa volumes, they can also be funded by non-card payment options.\n\nAlternative Payments Providers: These providers, such as closed commerce ecosystems, BNPL solutions and cryptocurrency platforms, often have a primary focus of enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels; however, they are expanding or may expand their offerings to the physical point of sale. These companies may process payments using in-house account transfers between parties, electronic funds transfer networks like the ACH, global or local networks like Visa, or some combination of the foregoing. In some cases, these entities can be both a partner and a competitor to Visa.\n\nReal-time  Payment  (RTP)  Networks: RTP  networks  have  launched  in  multiple  markets,  mainly  driven  by government sponsorship and regulatory intervention. These networks primarily focus on domestic transactions, with adoption  varying  by  use  cases  and  geographies.  They  can  compete  with  Visa  on  consumer  payments  and  other payment flows (e.g., B2B and P2P) but can be partners for value added services, such as risk management.\n\nPayment  Processors: We  compete  with  payment  processors  for  the  processing  of  Visa  transactions.  These processors may benefit from mandates requiring them to handle processing under local regulation. For example, as a result  of  regulation  in  Europe  under  the  Interchange  Fee  Regulation  (IFR),  we  may  face  competition  from  other networks, processors and other third parties who could process Visa transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\nValue Added Service and New Flows Providers: We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value added services as well as new flows (e.g., Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect). This includes a wide range of  players,  such  as  technology  companies,  information  services  and  consulting  firms,  governments  and  merchant services companies. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in these areas.\n\nWe  believe  our  fundamental  value  proposition  of  security,  convenience,  speed  and  reliability  as  well  as  the number of credentials and our acceptance footprint help us to succeed. In addition, we understand the needs of the individual markets in which we operate and partner with local financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, governments, NGOs and business organizations to provide tailored and innovative solutions. We will continue to utilize our network of networks  strategy  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  money.  We  believe  Visa  is  well-positioned  competitively  due  to  our global brand, our broad set of payment products, new flows offerings and value added services, and our proven track record of processing payment transactions securely and reliably.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  evolving  global  regulations  in  the various  jurisdictions  in  which  our  products  and  services  are  used. The  most  significant  government  regulations  that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A-Risk Factors-Regulatory Risks .\n\nAnti-Corruption, Anti-Money  Laundering, Anti-Terrorism  and  Sanctions: We are  subject  to  anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. We are also subject to antimoney laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or other entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are included  on  OFAC's  list  of  Specially  Designated  Nationals  and  Blocked  Persons,  to  issue  or  acquire  Visa  cards  or engage in transactions using our services.",

      "answer": "MetLife explicitly states that the valuation of its embedded derivatives includes changes in nonperformance risk as a key input, with these instruments being sensitive to shifts in creditworthiness. AIG, on the other hand, reported a $623 million gain from embedded derivatives in 2021, contrasting sharply with a $4,722 million loss in 2020. This significant fluctuation in AIG's embedded derivative performance suggests high sensitivity to market and credit risk factors, similar to MetLife\u2019s disclosures, indicating both companies face material impacts from nonperformance risk in their derivative portfolios.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nPrior  to  adopting  the  credit  loss  guidance,  we  applied  the  other  than  temporary  impairment  model,  where  credit  loss  was recognized when it was anticipated that amortized cost of the security would not be recovered. The credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss are generally similar under the credit loss guidance and the other than temporary impairment model.\n\n## Mortgage Loans\n\nThe  ACL  is  established  both  for  pools  of  loans  with  similar  risk  characteristics  and  for  loans  with  dissimilar  risk characteristics, collateral dependent loans and reasonably expected troubled debt restructurings, individually on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans that we do not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loans being presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  In  accordance  with  credit  loss  guidance  adopted  January  1,  2020,  to  determine  the  mortgage  loan ACL,  we  apply significant  judgement  to  estimate  expected  lifetime  credit  loss  over  the  contractual  term  of  our  mortgage  loans  adjusted  for expected prepayments and any extensions; and we consider past events and current and forecasted economic conditions which are subject to inherent uncertainty and which necessarily change from time to time. The ACL methodologies, significant inputs and significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the amount of credit loss are described in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the amount of ACL is subjective as it includes our estimates and assumptions and assessment of known and inherent risks. We revise these estimates as conditions change and new information becomes  available.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  our  mortgage  loan  portfolio  is  sensitive  to  changes  in  interest  rates  and  the estimated fair value of the portion of our mortgage loan portfolio that is foreign denominated, is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nPrior to adopting the credit loss guidance, we used the incurred loss model, where credit loss was recognized when incurred (when it was probable, based on current information and events, that all amounts due under the loan agreement would not be collected).  The  credit  loss  evaluation  process  and  the  measurement  of  credit  loss  are  generally  similar  under  the  credit  loss guidance and the incurred loss model, except that the credit loss guidance requires recording an ACL for expected lifetime credit loss.\n\n## Real Estate, Leases and Other Asset Classes\n\nThe determination of the amount of ACL on leases and impairments on real estate and the remaining asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. The evaluation processes, measurement methodologies, significant inputs and significant judgments and assumptions used to determine the amount of ACL and impairments are described in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would  use  when  pricing  the  instruments.  Derivative  valuations  can  be  affected  by  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreign  currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.",

Fair Value (continued)\n\nRisk  margins  are  established  to  capture  the  non-capital  market  risks  of  the  instrument  which  represent  the  additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization,  premium  persistency,  partial  withdrawal  and  surrenders.  The  establishment  of  risk  margins  requires  the  use  of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to,  changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income.\n\nThe  Company  ceded  the  risk  associated  with  certain  of  the  GMIBs  previously  described.  These  reinsurance  agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on  the  statement  of  operations  classification  of  the  direct  risk.  The  value  of  the  embedded  derivatives  on  the  ceded  risk  is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds  withheld  liability.  The  estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  is  determined  as  described  in  '-  Investments -  Securities,  Short-term  Investments  and  Other  Investments.'  The  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair  value  recorded  in  net  derivative  gains  (losses).  Changes  in  the  credit  spreads  on  the  underlying  assets,  interest  rates  and market  volatility  may  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in  the  estimated  fair  value  of  these  embedded  derivatives  that  could materially affect net income.\n\nThe Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the  policyholder  using  actuarial  and  present  value  assumptions  including  expectations  concerning  policyholder  behavior,  is calculated by the Company's actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.\n\n## Embedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts\n\n## Level 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\n\nDirect and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques,  which  utilize  significant  inputs  that  may  include  swap  yield  curves,  currency  exchange  rates  and  implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities,  actuarial  assumptions  for  policyholder  behavior  and  mortality  and  the  potential  variability  in  policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.",

      "question": "How does PayPal's concentration risk with two third-party custodians for $242 million in upcoming data center leases compare to JPMorgan Chase's operational risk exposure from theft or fraud, particularly given both companies' reliance on external parties for asset safeguarding?",
      "answer": "PayPal's concentration risk with two third-party custodians, as stated in its 2023 10-K filing, highlights vulnerabilities tied to $242 million in upcoming data center leases, as a failure by these custodians to perform could disrupt crypto asset safeguarding and impact PayPal\u2019s financial performance. JPMorgan Chase, on the other hand, acknowledges operational risks from theft or fraud tied to its reliance on external parties, including custodians and vendors, which could materially affect its business operations, reputation, and financial outcomes. Both companies face significant risks from external entities, but PayPal's exposure is more narrowly tied to crypto custodial arrangements, while JPMorgan\u2019s risk spans broader operational and reputational impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PYPL \u2192 Third-Party Custodians: PayPal utilizes two third-party custodians for crypto asset safeguarding, and as of December 31, 2023, has $242 million in upcoming data center lease commitments, creating concentration risk if custodians fail to perform.",
        "Hop 2: Third-Party Custodians \u2192 Theft: PayPal\u2019s custodians are exposed to theft or loss of crypto assets, which could lead to customer claims, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm, as outlined in the risk factors section of its 2023 10-K.",
        "Hop 3: Theft \u2190 JPM: JPMorgan Chase identifies theft, fraud, or unlawful conduct by employees or third parties as a significant operational risk that could result in financial liability, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage, as detailed in its 2023 10-K."

      "question": "How does BlackRock's exposure to Dodd-Frank Act-mandated trading venue execution requirements for swaps transactions compare with the enhanced prudential standards Schwab faces, particularly regarding operational complexity and compliance timelines?",
      "answer": "BlackRock is subject to Dodd-Frank Act-mandated trading venue execution requirements for certain swaps transactions, which have increased the complexity and cost of derivatives trading for its clients and introduced operational and legal risks. These requirements apply to specific swaps such as interest rate and index credit default swaps, and BlackRock must comply with execution on registered electronic venues, transaction reporting, and margin posting. Meanwhile, Schwab faces enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk management, liquidity stress testing, and single counterparty credit limits, with compliance timelines starting as early as January 1, 2021. While BlackRock\u2019s exposure centers on trading operations and regulatory inconsistencies across jurisdictions, Schwab\u2019s obligations are more focused on internal risk controls and capital buffers, indicating differing operational impacts despite shared regulatory origins.",

      "answer": "American Express National Bank is subject to the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) as part of its regulatory capital requirements, which is computed under the Basel III framework using the standardized approach. In contrast, Morgan Stanley's capital buffer requirement includes the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), which is part of a broader sum that also includes the CCB (2.5%), G-SIB capital surcharge, and CCyB. This indicates that while both institutions are subject to regulatory buffers, Morgan Stanley's capital adequacy framework incorporates additional stress-based components not explicitly mentioned in American Express's disclosures.",

        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Capital Conservation Buffer: American Express National Bank is subject to the Capital Conservation Buffer as defined under Basel III using the standardized approach for risk-weighted assets.",

        "Hop 3: Stress Capital Buffer \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley explicitly references the Stress Capital Buffer in its regulatory capital framework and ties it to restrictions on capital distributions like dividends and executive bonuses."

      "answer": "The $3.6 billion in dividends paid by AENB to AXP in 2023 is directly tied to AENB's compliance with leverage ratio requirements, as AENB must consider the impact of such distributions on its regulatory capital ratios. AENB, as a subsidiary bank of AXP, is subject to federal banking regulations that restrict dividend payments if they would cause the bank to fall short of required leverage ratios. Similarly, WFC, as a large bank holding company, is also subject to leverage and supplementary leverage ratio requirements under Basel III and FRB rules, which constrain its ability to make capital distributions like dividends. Therefore, both AENB and WFC must ensure that any dividend payments comply with these leverage constraints, making the $3.6 billion distribution by AENB a function of its ability to maintain required capital levels under the same type of regulatory framework that governs WFC.",

      "question": "How do COF's exposure to interest rate-driven capital pressures compare to AXP's constraints on capital distributions through its AENB subsidiary under current regulatory thresholds?",
      "answer": "COF faces potential capital pressures due to interest rate fluctuations that could impact its regulatory capital and cost of funding, especially as rising rates may accelerate securitization amortization and increase borrowing costs. In contrast, AXP operates under explicit capital distribution limits tied to AENB's regulatory status, where dividend restrictions apply if capital ratios fall below minimum thresholds such as a 6.5% CET1 ratio. AXP must also maintain at least an 8.0% Tier 1 capital ratio and a 10.0% Total capital ratio to remain classified as 'well capitalized' under the FDIA, directly affecting its ability to return capital to shareholders. These regulatory frameworks create different sensitivities: COF faces dynamic market-driven capital risks, while AXP\u2019s capital actions are more directly governed by statutory thresholds through its subsidiary AENB.",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate  of  defaults  by  account  holders  and  borrowers  domestically  and  internationally.  These  social  factors  include  changes  in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if  consumption  trends  decline  or  if  we  fail  to  maintain  and  enhance  our  brand,  or  we  incur  significant  expenses  to  do  so,  our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.\n\n## If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and  distribution  of  our  other  proprietary  information.  These  measures  may  not  prevent  misappropriation  of  our  proprietary information  or  infringement  of  our  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  resulting  loss  of  competitive  advantage.  In  addition,  our competitors  or  other  third  parties  may  obtain  patents  for  innovations  that  are  used  in  our  industry  or  allege  that  our  systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. If our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining  such  patents  or  prevail  in  intellectual  property-related  litigation  against  us,  we  could  lose  significant  revenues,  incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant damages.\n\n## Our  risk  management  strategies  may  not  be  fully  effective  in  mitigating  our  risk  exposures  in  all  market  environments  or against all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity, operational and compliance risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. See 'MD&amp;A-Risk Management' for further details. Even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework, our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. These  methods  may  not  accurately  predict  future  exposures,  which  could  be  significantly  greater  than  the  historical measures  indicate  and  market  conditions,  particularly  during  a  period  of  financial  market  stress,  can  involve  unprecedented dislocations. For example, credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers. Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs due, for example,  to  rapid  changes  in  the  economy,  or  degradation  in  the  predictive  nature  of  credit  bureau  and  other  data  used  in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that  accompany  their  application  cannot  anticipate  every  economic  and  financial  outcome  or  the  timing  of  such  outcomes.  For example, our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result, may limit our ability to distribute such risks (for instance, when we seek to syndicate exposure  in  bridge  financing  transactions  we  have  underwritten).  We  may,  therefore,  incur  losses  in  the  course  of  our  risk management or investing activities.\n\n## Fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility  in  the  capital  markets  could  adversely  affect  our  income  and  expense,  the value of assets and obligations, our regulatory capital, cost of capital or liquidity.\n\nLike other financial institutions,  our  business  is  sensitive  to  market  interest  rate  movements  and  the  performance  of  the  capital markets. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity, limit our access to the funding and capital required to operate and grow our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. For example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interest-earning assets. We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and  depositors.  The  interest  rates  that  we  pay  on  the  securities  we  have  issued  are  also  influenced  by,  among  other  things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Increased chargeoffs, rising interest rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDue to the economic uncertainty related to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR, but allowed them to pay common stock dividends provided (a) they did not increase the amount of the dividend and (b) the dividends did not exceed the average of a firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. During the first and second quarters of 2021, the Federal Reserve allowed bank holding companies participating in CCAR to repurchase common stock and pay common stock dividends provided (a) the repurchases and dividends, in the aggregate, did not exceed the average of a firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and (b) the firm did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of 2020. The Federal Reserve also permitted stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. These capital distribution restrictions ceased to apply on July 1, 2021. For additional information regarding our capital distributions, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\nWe may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments, such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition. If we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument.\n\n## Dividends and Other Capital Distributions\n\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company's insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy.\n\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve, as described above. The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if, among other things, (i) the Company's regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or (ii) the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan.\n\nIn general, federal laws and regulations prohibit, without first obtaining the OCC's approval, AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS, if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution.\n\n## Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. In order to be considered 'well capitalized,' AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\n\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party brokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits.\n\nIn December 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to update and modernize the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations. Effective April 1, 2021, the final rule, among other things, expanded the definition of 'deposit broker' and updated the interest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks.",

These funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least $250,000 per account holder through the FDIC. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on, among other factors, the capital level of AENB. Direct retail deposits offered by AENB is our primary deposit product channel, which makes FDIC-insured high-yield savings account and certificates of deposit (CDs) products available directly to consumers. AENB also offers checking account products and sources deposits through third-party distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives. As of December 31, 2021, we had $84.4 billion in deposits. Refer to Note 7 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits.\n\n## SHORT-TERM FUNDING PROGRAMS\n\nShort-term borrowings, such as commercial paper, are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less, as well as interest-bearing overdrafts with banks. Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had nil commercial paper outstanding and an average of nil in commercial paper outstanding during 2021.

During 2021, we issued $5.8 billion of unsecured debt and asset-backed securities with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. Refer to Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.\n\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets.

          "chunk_text": "## Investment Strategy\n\nThe Company's global pension and postretirement funds' investment strategy is to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with the Company's contributions to the funds, will maintain the funds' ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities, fix ed income securities and cash and short-term investments. The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is primarily in equity and debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local statutory requirements and economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments, government funds or localcountry securities.\n\n## Significant Concentrations of Risk in Plan Assets\n\nThe assets of the Company's pension plans are diversified to limit the impact of any individual investment. The U.S. qualified pension plan is diversified across multiple asset classes, with publicly traded fix ed income, hedge funds, private equity and publicly traded equity representing the most significant asset allocations. Investments in these four asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers, strategies, vintages, sectors and geographies, depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class. The pension assets for the Company's non-U.S. Significant Plans are primarily invested in publicly traded fix ed income and publicly traded equity securities.\n\n## Oversight and Risk Management Practices\n\nThe framework for the Company's pension oversight process includes monitoring of retirement plans by plan fiduciaries and/or management at the global, cluster or country level, as appropriate. Independent Risk Management contributes to the risk oversight and monitoring for the Company's U.S. Qualified Pension Plan and non-U.S. Significant Pension Plans. Although the specific components of the oversight process are tailored to the requirements of each cluster, country and plan, the following elements are common to the Company's monitoring and risk management process:\n\n- periodic asset/liability management studies and strategic asset allocation reviews;\n- periodic monitoring of funding levels and funding ratios;\n- periodic monitoring of compliance with asset allocation guidelines;\n- periodic monitoring of asset class and/or investment manager performance against benchmarks; and\n- periodic risk capital analysis and stress testing.\n\n## Estimated Future Benefit Payments\n\nThe Company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years:\n\n",

For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.\n\nFixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fix ed income investments are categorized as  Level  3  when  valuations  using  observable  inputs  are  unavailable.  The  trustee  typically  obtains  pricing  based  on  indicative  quotes  or  bid  evaluations  from vendors, brokers or the investment manager.

The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between eight and 12 years.\n\nReal estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient. The NAV  valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between eight and 10 years.\n\nHedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV  practical expedient.

      "answer": "MetLife has issued 40,000 shares of Series F preferred stock, which includes a redemption clause triggered by a 'rating agency event'\u2014defined as a change in rating criteria that lowers equity credit assigned to such securities. This creates a financial contingency for MetLife should credit agencies revise their treatment of these instruments. Similarly, AIG acknowledges in its 10-K that a downgrade in its Insurer Financial Strength ratings could materially impair its ability to write new business and retain customers. Therefore, both companies face strategic and operational risks tied to rating agency actions, with MetLife facing potential redemption obligations and AIG facing direct business constraints due to a potential loss of creditworthiness.",

We use several approaches to measure liquidity risk exposure including coverage flow forecasts and stress testing.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. Operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business entities and can have many impacts, including but not limited to, unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.\n\nERM, working together with other control and assurance functions and first line Risk Control Owners through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each of the business areas.\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk\n\nAIG, like other global companies, continues to witness the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties attempting cyber and other computer-related penetrations such as 'denial of service' attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks, and other disruptive software in an effort to compromise systems, networks and obtain sensitive information.\n\nERM works closely with and supports the risk management practices of Information Technology, the Information Security Office and the business units and functions that form the lines of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face.\n\nFor additional information regarding the privacy data protection and cybersecurity regulations to which we are subject, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Regulation - Privacy, Data Protection, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence Requirements. For additional discussion of cybersecurity risks, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operations. For additional information regarding our cybersecurity risk management as well as strategy and governance, please see Part 1, Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\n## BUSINESS AND STRATEGY RISKS\n\nBusiness and strategy risk encompasses those risks that stem from strategy risk, risk of legal and regulatory actions, risk of rating agency actions, reputational risk and intercompany dependencies. The major AIG strategy risks capture risk of losses due to the inability to implement appropriate business plans and strategies, make decisions, allocate resources or adapt to changes in the business environment. These risks include, but are not limited to pricing, distribution channels, acquisitions, and dispositions. The risk of legal and regulatory actions is defined as the risk that legal action or a change in regulation in the regions in which A IG does business will materially impact business operations, financial performance, and/or capital requirements. Risk drivers include, but are not limited to, adverse actions in legal or regulatory environment, and adverse actions or added complexity of accounting/tax standards. A  downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of A IG's insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and inforce business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Reputational risk events are typically linked to risk incidents, whether internal (e.g., data priv acy  breaches, fraud, etc.) or ex ternal (e.g., non-A IG insurance losses). The reputational impact may magnify the financial consequences of the original risk event (e.g., reduced sales in addition to fines).\n\n84\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does MetLife's repayment strategy for its junior subordinated debentures compare to AIG's obligations under the AIGLH-issued junior subordinated debentures, particularly in terms of liquidity constraints and deferral provisions?",
      "answer": "MetLife has provisions allowing it to defer interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures under certain conditions, which in turn triggers dividend stopper provisions. Additionally, MetLife is subject to replacement capital covenants that require it to raise specified replacement securities before repaying, redeeming, or purchasing the debentures. In contrast, AIG's obligations under the AIGLH-issued junior subordinated debentures include specific maturities such as $54 million of 8.5% debentures due in 2030, $142 million of 8.125% debentures due in 2046, and $31 million of 7.57% debentures due in 2045, all of which are guaranteed by AIG Parent. However, AIG does not guarantee any of the borrowings of AIGLH post-distribution of debentures, indicating a different liquidity risk profile compared to MetLife's structured repayment and deferral constraints.",

In the case of successive Trigger Events, the suspension would continue until MetLife satisfies these conditions for each of the Trigger Events.\n\nThe  junior  subordinated  debentures  further  provide  that  MetLife,  Inc.  may,  at  its  option  and  provided  that  certain conditions are met, elect to defer payment of interest. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Any such elective deferral would trigger the dividend stopper provisions.\n\nFurther,  MetLife,  Inc.  is  a  party  to  certain  replacement  capital  covenants  which  limit  its  ability  to  eliminate  these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of the junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, Inc., with some limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such covenants.\n\n## Debt Repayments\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  following  regulatory  approval,  MetLife  Reinsurance  Company  of Charleston, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $79 million and $148 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes, which were reported in collateral financing arrangement on the consolidated balance sheets. See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt and the collateral financing arrangement, respectively.\n\n## Debt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\n\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.\n\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the redemption and cancellation of senior notes.\n\n## Support Agreements\n\nMetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an 'Obligor') are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees  with  subsidiaries.  Under  these  arrangements,  each  Obligor  has  agreed  to  cause  the  applicable  entity  to  meet specified  capital  and  surplus  levels  or  has  guaranteed  certain  contractual  obligations.

The Dodd-Frank Act further mandates that federal banking agencies jointly adopt rules to enforce this requirement, although such rules have not yet been finalized. In contrast, Schwab discloses that the Dodd-Frank Act has expanded prudential regulation for large financial institutions but does not specify any direct obligations related to serving as a source of strength. Schwab\u2019s filing focuses more on definitions and internal metrics (e.g., CET1 capital ratios, HQLA, and LCR), rather than obligations to support subsidiary banks financially. Thus, while both firms are subject to Dodd-Frank, Capital One faces more specific and enforceable expectations tied to its banking structure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFDIC may jointly determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the Company were to fail to adequately address deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in a timely manner, it may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. In July 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC ex tended the deadline for the next full resolution submission from March 31, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required by FDIC regulation to submit its own resolution plan to the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule amending the resolution plan submission requirements applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank. Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the LTD Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Regulation Y  requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (this is known as the 'source of strength doctrine'). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and further requires the Federal Banking Agencies to jointly adopt rules implementing this requirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority.\n\n## FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ('DIF') maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio ('DRR') for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFDIC may jointly determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the Company were to fail to adequately address deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in a timely manner, it may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. In July 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC ex tended the deadline for the next full resolution submission from March 31, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is required by FDIC regulation to submit its own resolution plan to the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule amending the resolution plan submission requirements applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank. Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the LTD Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Regulation Y  requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (this is known as the 'source of strength doctrine'). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and further requires the Federal Banking Agencies to jointly adopt rules implementing this requirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority.\n\n## FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ('DIF') maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio ('DRR') for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "BAC originates and funds mortgage loans, managing credit, liquidity, and interest rate risks by selling or securitizing a portion of these loans. This securitization process connects directly to pass-through mortgage-backed securities, which MET holds as part of its structured products portfolio. MET reported $12,567 million in pass-through mortgage-backed securities in 2024, representing 36.8% of its RMBS portfolio, with a net unrealized loss of $1,294 million. BAC's use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risks associated with mortgage loans held for sale (LHFS) and interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) directly affects the market value of these underlying loans, which in turn influences the valuation and risk profile of the pass-through securities MET holds.",

          "chunk_text": "in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n\nRisk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks  related  to  various  foreign  currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities  and eliminate  substantially  all  foreign  currency  exposures  in  the  cash  flows  of  the Corporation's  non-trading  foreign  currency-denominated  financial  instruments. These  foreign  exchange  derivatives  are  sensitive  to  other  market  risk  exposures such  as  cross-currency  basis  spreads  and  interest  rate  risk.  However ,  as  these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 - Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Mortgage Banking Risk Management\n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment  or  held  for  sale  at  th e  time  of  commitment  and  manage  credit  and liq uid ity risks b y selling or securitizing a p ortion of th e loans we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date  of  th e  IR LC  a nd   th e  d a te  th e  loa ns  a re  sold   to  th e  second a ry  m a rket.  A n increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these  instruments.  Conversely ,  when  there  is  an  increase  in  interest  rates,  th e value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the  interest  rate  risks  of  th ese  h ed ged   items  offset,  we  comb ine  th em  into  one overall  h ed ged   item  with   one  comb ined   economic  h ed ge  portfolio  consisting  of derivative contracts and securities.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or  damage  to  the  reputation  of  the  Corporation  arising  from  the  failure  of  the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable LRRs and our internal policies and procedures (collectively , applicable LRRs). We  are subject to comprehensive  and  evolving  regulation  under  federal  and  state  laws,  rules  and regulations in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including  those  related  to  financial  crimes  and  anti-money  laundering,  market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy , data protection, development and use of AI, and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  or systems,  people or external events, and  includes legal risk. Operational  risk  may  occur  anywhere  in  the  Corporation,  including  third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces  a  number  of  key  operational  risks  including  third-party  risk,  model  risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. The pace of technological change, including in the field of AI, may heighten risks in those areas. Operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and i s a component in the  calculation  of  total  R WA  used  in  th e  Basel  3  capital  calculation.  For  more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 48.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and  control  functions  are  required  to  understand  their  business  processes  and related  risks  and  controls,  including  third-party  dependencies  and  the  related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment.  In  order  to  actively  monitor  and  assess  the  performance  of  their processes  and  controls,  they  must  conduct  comprehensive  quality  assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally , FLUs  and  control  functions  are  responsible  for  the  proactive  identification, management  and  escalation  of  compliance  and  operational  risks  across  the Corporation. Collectively , th ese efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency , which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption. T o address AI-related risks, we have implemented internal processes and governance  frameworks.  These  measures  help  with  regulatory  compliance  and responsible use of AI across our operations.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational  risk,  monitor  business  activities  and  processes  and evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable LRRs, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting on the state of the control environment. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of  key  compliance  and  operational  risk  processes  and  controls  across  the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance - Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management - Enterprise Policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational  risk  information  to  executive  management  as  well  as  the  Board  or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk's  responsibilities  for  conducting  independent  oversight  of  the  Corporation's compliance  and  operational  risk  management  activities.  The  Board  provides oversight  of  compliance  risk  through  its  Audit  Committee  and  the  ERC,  and operational risk through its ERC.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nCybersecurity is a key operational risk facing the Corporation. We, our employees, customers,  regulators  and  third  parties  are  ongoing  targets  of  an  increasing number of cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks and, accordingly , the Corporation devotes considerable resources to the establishment and maintenance of processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risk through its global workforce and  2 4/7 cyber operations centers around  the world. The Corporation takes a cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with our  Global  T echnology ,  Global  Risk  Management,  Legal  and  Corporate  Audit functions  playing  key  roles.  In  addition,  th e  Corporation's  processes  related  to cybersecurity  risk  are  an  element  of  and  integrated  with  the  Corporation's comprehensive risk program, including our risk framework.

Our investment selection criteria and monitoring include review of credit ratings, characteristics of the assets underlying the securities, borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement. We held $63.7 billion and $56.3 billion of Structured Products at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS sections below.\n\n## RMBS\n\nOur RMBS portfolio is broadly diversified by security type and risk profile.\n\nOn a security type basis, RMBS includes collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\n\nOn a risk profile basis, RMBS includes Agency and Non-Agency securities. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National Mortgage Association,  Federal  Home  Loan  Mortgage  Corporation  or  G overnment  National  Mortgage  Association.  Non-Agency  securities  include  prime,  prime investor,  non-qualified  residential  mortgage  ('NQM'),  and  alternative  residential  mortgage  loans  ('Alt-A'),  and  reperforming  and  sub-prime  mortgage-backed securities. Prime (owner-occupied) and prime investor (non-owner-occupied) loans were originated to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. NQM and Alt-A are classifications of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime.  Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles, while reperforming loans were previously delinquent that returned to performing status.",

      "answer": "American Express faces constraints in accessing capital markets and funding its operations due to adverse market conditions, which could increase its cost of capital and reduce financial flexibility, especially in stressed environments. These conditions also negatively impact operational risk, as seen in how macroeconomic volatility affects transaction volumes and increases credit losses, as noted in JPMorganChase's 2024 filing. Goldman Sachs, in turn, has structured a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that includes operational risk as a core component, with a three-line defense model involving governance, independent oversight, and internal audit to manage such macroeconomic exposures.",

        "Hop 1: AXP \u2192 Adverse Market Conditions: AXP's ability to fund its operations through capital markets and securitizations is constrained by adverse market conditions, which could increase its cost of capital and reduce financial flexibility.",
        "Hop 2: Adverse Market Conditions \u2192 Operational Risk: Adverse macroeconomic conditions can increase operational risk by reducing transaction volumes, increasing credit losses, and creating challenges in managing client assets and commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock. Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\n\nWe are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators, who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing process, our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the stress capital buffer, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\n\nOur ability to declare or pay dividends on, or to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock.\n\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and such dividends may be limited by law, regulation or supervisory policy. For example, AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends. These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations, make dividend payments or otherwise achieve strategic objectives.\n\nAny future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express. For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions, see 'Supervision and Regulation - Stress Testing and Capital Planning' and '- Dividends and Other Capital Distributions' under 'Business,' as well as 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity - Dividends and Share Repurchases' under 'MD&amp;A' and Note 22 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements.'\n\n## Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\n\nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flex ibility. Additional factors affecting the ex tent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' under 'MD&amp;A.'\n\n## Any reduction in our credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRatings of our long-term and short-term debt and deposits are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, and the macroeconomic environment. Our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies, which could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends, in part, on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts. If we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of our asset-backed securities, it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets.\n\n## Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations.\n\nDuring 2024, approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nPolitical and economic conditions could continue to cause changes in the values of currencies and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our net revenues. Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members' currency can also affect their ability to make payment to us. Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars or our ability to transfer them and the availability of foreign exchange could further impact our results of operations.\n\n## An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiary, AENB, accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. We continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. Additionally, a decrease in confidence in the soundness of us or in the banking sector more broadly, such as following the occurrence of bank failures, or in the level of insurance available on deposits may cause rapid deposit withdrawals or an unwillingness to maintain deposits with us,",

          "chunk_text": "Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorganChase's earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies, including where declining industrial or manufacturing activ ity has resulted in or could result in higher lev els of unemployment, or where high lev els of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.\n\nJPMorganChase's earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by gov ernmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:\n\n- policies and initiativ es relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and housing, or that may impact employment status\n- laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the financial serv ices industry, such as limitations on late payment, ov erdraft and interchange fees, and\n- policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation, which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.\n\n## Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's wholesale businesses.\n\nIn JPMorganChase's wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the v olume of transactions that JPMorganChase executes for its clients or for which it adv ises clients, and, therefore, the rev enue that JPMorganChase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and inv estors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorganChase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorganChase's businesses engaged in capital markets activ ities, including loan syndication, securities underwriting and lev eraged lending activ ities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\n- earn less fee rev enue due to lower transaction v olumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfav orable market conditions, or\n- dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at fav orable prices.\n\nThe fees that JPMorganChase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset v alues or other adv erse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the v aluation of client assets that JPMorganChase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorganChase's rev enue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adv erse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorganChase funds or accounts, or cause clients to inv est in products that generate lower rev enue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorganChase fund can also hamper the inv estment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadv antageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker inv estment performance.\n\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, sev ere declines in commercial real estate values, or sustained changes in consumer behav ior that affect specific economic sectors, could hav e a material adv erse effect on clients of JPMorganChase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorganChase could incur credit losses on its loans and other commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is or comes under stress.\n\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behav ior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also hav e a negativ e impact on certain of JPMorganChase's wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorganChase's earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorganChase's wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties, including offices, which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adv erse economic conditions or hybrid work models could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or dev elopers receiv e from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the v alues of the properties, impair the ability of borrowers to serv ice or refinance their commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These consequences could result in JPMorganChase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for serv icing a larger v olume of delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in higher operational risk associated with JPMorganChase owning and managing real property,",

          "chunk_text": "## Risk Management\n\nRisks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational,  cybersecurity,  model,  legal,  compliance,  conduct,  regulatory and reputational risks. For further information about our risk management processes,  see  'Overview  and  Structure  of  Risk  Management,'  and  for information  about  our  areas  of  risk,  see  'Liquidity  Risk  Management,' 'Market Risk Management,' 'Credit Risk Management,' 'Operational Risk Management,' 'Cybersecurity Risk Management,' 'Model Risk Management' and 'Other Risk Management,' as well as 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Overview and Structure of Risk Management\n\n## Overview\n\nEffective  risk  management  is  critical  to  our  success.  Accordingly,  we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive,  integrated  approach  to  risk  management  and  is  designed to  enable  comprehensive  risk  management  processes  through  which  we identify,  assess,  monitor  and  manage  the  risks  we  assume  in  conducting our  activities.  Our  risk  management  structure  is  built  around  three  core components: governance, processes and people.\n\nGovernance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both  directly  and  through  its  committees,  including  its  Risk  Committee, oversees our approach to managing our risks through the enterprise risk management  framework.  The  Board  is  also  responsible  for  the  annual review  and  approval  of  our  risk  appetite  statement.  The  risk  appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to  avoid  in  order  to  achieve  our  objectives  included  in  our  strategy  and business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements.  The  Board  reviews  our  strategy  and  business  plan  and  is ultimately  responsible  for  overseeing  and  providing  direction  about  our strategy and risk appetite.\n\nThe Board, including through its committees, receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model  risk and climate risk, from  our chief risk officer,  on cybersecurity threats and risks from our chief information security officer (CISO), on compliance risk and conduct risk from our chief compliance officer, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from our chief legal officer,  and  on  other  matters  impacting  our  reputation  from  the  chair and/or  vice-chairs  of  our  Firmwide  Reputational  Risk  Committee.  The chief  risk  officer  reports  to  our  chief  executive  officer  and  to  the  Risk Committee  of  the  Board.  As  part  of  the  review  of  the  firmwide  risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\n\nEnterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, is responsible for ensuring  that  our  enterprise  risk  management  framework  provides  the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nOur first line of defense consists of our revenue-producing units, Conflicts  Resolution,  Controllers,  Engineering,  Corporate  Treasury  and certain  other  corporate  functions.  The  first  line  of  defense  is  responsible for its risk-generating activities, as well as for the design and execution of controls to mitigate such risks.\n\nOur  Risk  and  Compliance  functions  are  considered  our  second  line  of defense  and  provide  independent  assessment,  oversight  and  challenge  of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in firmwide risk committees.\n\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively  to  our  chief  executive  officer.  Internal  Audit  includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including  risk  management  expertise.  Internal  Audit  is  responsible  for independently  assessing  and  validating  the  effectiveness  of  key  controls, including  those  within  the  risk  management  framework,  and  providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.\n\nThe  three  lines  of  defense  structure  promotes  the  accountability  of  first line  risk  takers,  provides  a  framework  for  effective  challenge  by  the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.",

      "question": "How does Wells Fargo's regulatory exposure under the Dodd-Frank Act influence its capital management flexibility compared to AIG, given the impact of covered agreements on AIG's global group supervision?",
      "answer": "Wells Fargo, as a bank holding company, is subject to extensive Dodd-Frank Act requirements that constrain its capital management through higher capital buffers, stress testing, and liquidity requirements. In contrast, AIG benefits from covered agreements under Dodd-Frank Title V that exempt it from EU Solvency II group capital and governance requirements, allowing AIG to be supervised only by U.S. regulators at the worldwide group level. These covered agreements also led to U.S. reinsurance collateral reforms now adopted by all U.S. states, enhancing AIG\u2019s international operations flexibility. This regulatory divergence gives AIG greater capital allocation freedom globally, while Wells Fargo faces more prescriptive federal banking constraints that limit its operational and capital flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: WFC \u2192 Dodd-Frank Act: Wells Fargo is subject to Dodd-Frank regulations that impose restrictions on capital distributions, require higher capital buffers, and mandate stress testing, all of which constrain its capital management flexibility.",
        "Hop 2: Dodd-Frank Act \u2192 Covered Agreements: Dodd-Frank Title V authorizes the U.S. to enter into covered agreements that establish international regulatory frameworks, including exemptions from EU Solvency II group capital and governance requirements for U.S. insurers.",
        "Hop 3: Covered Agreements \u2190 AIG: AIG is supervised globally only by U.S. insurance regulators due to these covered agreements, and it benefits from U.S. reinsurance collateral reforms adopted by all U.S. states, enhancing its international capital flexibility."

      "question": "How does AIG's personal insurance operations in the UK expose it to regulatory changes under the Overseas Fund Regime (OFR), and how might this compare to the impact of OFR on BlackRock's European-domiciled funds marketed to UK retail investors?",
      "answer": "AIG operates personal insurance lines in the UK, including automobile, homeowners', and specialty insurance products, which are subject to local regulatory conditions. The UK enacted the Overseas Fund Regime (OFR) in February 2022, requiring that consumer protection regimes in EU countries where non-UK funds are domiciled must be deemed equivalent to the UK's in order to market those funds in the UK. This regulatory framework affects BlackRock\u2019s European-domiciled funds, as they must comply with OFR to access UK retail investors. Since AIG\u2019s UK operations are insurance-based and not fund-based, its exposure to OFR is indirect but still relevant through the broader UK regulatory environment affecting financial services firms. BlackRock, on the other hand, faces direct compliance obligations under OFR, which may lead to increased operational costs and potential restrictions on fund distribution in the UK.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AIG \u2192 UK: AIG operates personal insurance lines in the UK, including accident and health, automobile, homeowners', and specialty insurance products.",
        "Hop 2: UK \u2192 OFR: The UK enacted the Overseas Fund Regime (OFR) in February 2022, which requires EU consumer protection regimes to be equivalent to the UK\u2019s for non-UK funds to be marketed to UK retail investors.",
        "Hop 3: OFR \u2190 BLK: BlackRock is directly impacted by OFR, as it must ensure its European-domiciled funds meet the regime\u2019s requirements to continue marketing to UK retail investors, potentially increasing compliance and operational costs."

F or exam ple, the SE C  adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final am endm ents to the rule governing fund nam es, expanding the scope of the rule to fund nam es including growth, value, E SG  or sim ilar term s, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investm ent advisers to service providers.\n\n## INTE R N ATIO N AL R E G U LATO R Y R E F O R M\n\n## Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms\n\nThe E U 's D igital O perational R esilience Act ('D O R A'), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, becam e applicable beginning in January 2025. D OR A, am ong other things: (1) introduces additional governance, risk m anagem ent, incident reporting, resilience testing and inform ation sharing requirem ents to several of BlackR ock's E uropean entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) m ay potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. T he E uropean Supervisory Authorities will use data collected under D O R A to assess which third party suppliers should be designated as critical to the E U  financial system  and becom e subject to further regulatory oversight. In 2024, the U K issued final policies regulating services provided by certain third parties designated by H M T  as 'critical' to the financial sector, which becam e effective in January 2025. Entities designated as 'critical' will be required to provide additional inform ation to financial regulators, engage in resilience testing and report m ajor incidents like cyber-attacks, natural disasters and power outages.\n\n## Retail Investment Strategy\n\nThe E U  continues to consider a proposed R etail Investm ent Strategy package of am endm ents intended to enhance protections for retail investors.

(Citibank), is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital ratios plus applicable regulatory buffers, as well as hold sufficient capital to be considered 'well capitalized' under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. In effect, Citibank's required CET1 Capital ratio was 7.0% under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which is the sum of the minimum 4.5% CET1 requirement and a fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. For additional information, see 'Regulatory Capital Buffers' and 'Prompt Corrective Action Framework' below.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III rules implement the 'capital floor provision' of the Dodd-Frank Act (the so-called 'Collins Amendment'), which requires banking organizations to calculate 'generally applicable' capital requirements. As a result, Citi must calculate each of the three riskbased capital ratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital) under both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches and comply with the more binding of each of the resulting risk-based capital ratios.\n\n## Leverage Ratio\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, Citigroup is also required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 4.0%. Similarly, Citibank is required to maintain a minimum Leverage ratio of 5.0% to be considered 'well capitalized' under the Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Leverage ratio, a non-riskbased measure of capital adequacy, is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n## Supplementary Leverage Ratio\n\nCiti is also required to calculate a Supplementary Leverage ratio (SLR), which differs from the Leverage ratio by including certain off-balance sheet exposures within the denominator of the ratio (Total Leverage Exposure). The SLR represents end-of-period Tier 1 Capital to Total Leverage Exposure. Total Leverage Exposure is defined as the sum of (i) the daily average of onbalance sheet assets for the quarter and (ii) the average of certain off-balance sheet ex posures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter, less applicable Tier 1 Capital deductions. Advanced Approaches banking organizations are required to maintain a stated minimum SLR of 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including Citigroup, are subject to a 2.0% leverage buffer in addition to the 3.0% stated minimum SLR requirement, resulting in a 5.0% SLR. If a U.S. GSIB fails to exceed this requirement, it will be subject to increasingly stringent restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) on capital distributions and discretionary ex ecutive bonus payments.\n\nSimilarly, Citibank is required to maintain a minimum SLR of 6.0% to be considered 'well capitalized' under the Prompt Corrective Action framework.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Treatment-Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule that modified the regulatory capital transition provision related to the current ex pected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The rule does not have any impact on U.S. GAAP accounting.\n\nThe rule permitted banks to delay for two years the 'Day One' adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology on January 1, 2020 until January 1, 2022, followed by a three-year transition to phase out the regulatory capital benefit provided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing impact of CECL, the agencies utilized a 25% scaling factor as an approximation of the increased reserve build under CECL compared to the previous incurred loss model and, therefore, allowed banks to add back to CET1 Capital an amount equal to 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the cumulative 25% change in CECL-based allowances between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 started to be phased in to regulatory capital (i) at 25% per year on January 1 of each year over the three-year transition period and (ii) along with the delayed Day One impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected the modified CECL transition provision provided by the rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the CECL methodology, as well as the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 and were fully reflected in Citi's regulatory capital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citigroup's reported Standardized Approach CET1 Capital ratio of 13.6% benefited from the deferrals of the CECL transition provision by 8 basis points. For additional information on Citigroup's and Citibank's regulatory capital ratios ex cluding the impact of the CECL transition provision, see 'Capital Resources (Full Adoption of CECL)' below.\n\n## Regulatory Capital Buffers\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to maintain several regulatory capital buffers above the stated minimum capital requirements. These capital buffers would be available to absorb losses in advance of any potential impairment of regulatory capital below the stated minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nBanking organizations that fall below their regulatory capital buffers are subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on a percentage of 'Eligible Retained Income' (ERI), with increasing restrictions based on the severity of the breach. ERI is equal to the greater of (i) the bank's net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of any distributions and tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of the bank's net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi's regulatory capital ratios ex ceeded the regulatory capital requirements.

The GSIB  surcharge  is  calculated  using  two  methodologies,  the  higher  of which is reflected in the firm's risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's methodology which,  among other  factors,  relies  upon  measures  of  the  size,  activity and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.",

      "answer": "Goldman Sachs' Series C Preferred Stock is explicitly non-voting and pays a fixed 10% annual dividend based on a $1,000 liquidation preference per share. In contrast, Bank of America structures its preferred stock such that only certain series (e.g., Series B and Series 1 through 5) carry general voting rights, while the rest, like many of its other preferred series, do not grant voting privileges. This indicates that both firms issue preferred stock with limited or no voting rights, but BAC retains a tiered voting structure across different series, whereas GS applies a uniform non-voting structure specifically to Series C.",

        "Hop 1: GS \u2192 Series C Preferred Stock: GS declared dividends of $345.49 per share for Series C Preferred Stock in January 2025, which carries a fixed 10% dividend rate on a $1,000 liquidation preference.",

This valuation is influenced by factors such as market conditions and modeling inputs.

In general, NAIC Designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. NAIC Designations for non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the NAIC. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG subsidiaries' fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. For fixed maturity securities where no NAIC Designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the NAIC Designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating.\n\nThe NAIC Designations presented below do not reflect the added granularity to the designation categories adopted by the NAIC in 2020, which further subdivide each category of fixed maturity securities by appending letter modifiers to the numerical designations.\n\nFor a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings see -Credit Ratings below .\n\nThe following table presents the fixed maturity security portfolio categorized by NAIC Designation, at fair value:\n\n",

      "answer": "The proposed G-SIB surcharge adjustments, which Morgan Stanley discusses as changing surcharge increments from 0.5-percentage-point to 0.1-percentage-point, would directly affect Wells Fargo's capital planning by increasing the precision and potentially the stringency of capital requirements they must meet. Wells Fargo explicitly states in their 2023 filings that they are subject to capital requirements and that changes in regulatory frameworks, such as the G-SIB surcharge, would influence their capital planning and operations during adverse economic conditions. Since the G-SIB Surcharge Proposal impacts capital requirements and Wells Fargo is subject to those requirements, the adjustment would necessitate more granular capital allocation and planning to ensure compliance with the finer increments of required capital.",

      "answer": "The UK's proposed Critical Third Party Regime, which would regulate third parties deemed critical to the financial sector, combined with the EU's DORA regulation, could subject BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin platform to increased oversight and compliance requirements. Specifically, DORA introduces governance, risk management, incident reporting, and resilience testing obligations for several of BlackRock's European entities and certain Aladdin clients starting in January 2025. Parallel to DORA, the UK\u2019s proposed regime may further regulate Aladdin if designated as 'critical' by HMT, requiring additional reporting and operational controls. These overlapping frameworks could increase operational costs and complexity for Aladdin\u2019s European clients and may impact Aladdin\u2019s ability to scale or innovate without regulatory friction.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 UK: JPMorgan Chase operates in the UK and is subject to heightened supervisory standards, including risk governance frameworks that address third-party services, indicating the UK regulatory environment is focused on operational resilience and third-party dependencies.",
        "Hop 2: UK \u2192 Critical Third Party Regime: The UK proposed a new regulatory framework targeting third parties deemed critical to the financial sector, with consultations expected in 2024, signaling increased oversight of external service providers like Aladdin.",
        "Hop 3: Critical Third Party Regime \u2190 BLK: BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin platform may be subject to additional oversight under both DORA (effective January 2025) and the UK\u2019s Critical Third Party Regime, which could constrain its operations and growth trajectory in Europe."

      "answer": "AIG's decline in CMBS holdings suggests a potential reduction in demand or confidence in commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are primarily collateralized by commercial mortgage loans (as disclosed in MET_10k_2023). This could signal tighter credit conditions or repricing of risk in the commercial real estate market. Morgan Stanley, which has exposure to VIE-backed transactions dependent on commercial mortgage loans (as detailed in MS_10k_2023), may face challenges in sourcing or securitizing new commercial mortgage loans due to reduced market liquidity or higher perceived risk\u2014potentially affecting the volume, pricing, or profitability of its structured finance activities.",

      "answer": "American Express National Bank is subject to a capital conservation buffer requirement, which mandates maintaining additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends. Bank of America, in addition to being subject to the same capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, must also comply with a G-SIB surcharge of 2.5%. Both banks currently benefit from a zero percent countercyclical capital buffer, which reduces their CET1 capital burden.

      "answer": "MA faces exposure to disintermediation risks due to regulations like PSD2 in the EEA, which enable third-party providers to route transactions away from its network, potentially diminishing demand for its integrated products. Technology companies, with whom MA partners, could develop competing platforms that disintermediate it from digital payments. Additionally, MA experiences pricing pressures that moderate its growth as customers demand better pricing arrangements and greater rebates. Similarly, V faces intense competition from technology companies that have developed alternative payment systems through ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels. These competitive pressures, combined with regulatory scrutiny, could force V to modify pricing structures, operating rules, or business practices. Both companies are vulnerable to technology-driven disintermediation and must navigate pricing pressures to maintain market position and profitability.",

We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UK's HM Revenue and Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in  the  future.  Relevant  tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  our  tax  treatment  of  certain  material  items  and  thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In  addition,  changes  in  existing  laws  in  the  U.S.  or  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  unilateral  actions  of  foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes, or changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program of Work, related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to  ensure  multinational  enterprises  pay  a  minimum  level  of  tax  to  the  countries  where  we  earn  revenue,  may  also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\n## Litigation Risks\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations.\n\nWe  are  involved  in  numerous  litigation  matters,  investigations,  and  proceedings  asserted  by  civil  litigants, governments,  and  enforcement  bodies  investigating  or  alleging,  among  other  things,  violations  of  competition  and antitrust law, consumer protection law, privacy law and intellectual property law (these are referred to as 'actions' in this section).  Details  of  the  most  significant  actions  we  face  are  described  more  fully  in Note  20-Legal Matters to  our consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this  report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the U.S., or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be  required  to  pay  significant  awards,  settlements  or  fines.  In  addition,  settlement  terms,  judgments,  orders  or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, investigators,  governments  or  civil  litigants  in  the  same  or  other  jurisdictions,  which  may  lead  to  additional  actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant.\n\nFor certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 5-U.S.  and  Europe  Retrospective  Responsibility  Plans and Note  20-Legal  Matters to  our  consolidated  financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent.\n\n## Business Risks\n\n## We face intense competition in our industry.\n\nThe  global  payments  space  is  intensely  competitive.  As  technology  evolves,  new  competitors  or  methods  of payment  emerge,  and  existing  clients  and  competitors  assume  different  roles.  Our  products  compete  with  cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, digital wallets and alternative payments providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce  and  mobile  channels.  As  the  global  payments  space  becomes  more  complex,  we  face  increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels, as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and India) as",

Additionally, MET emphasizes its reliance on vendors for critical systems and processes, and that failures in cybersecurity, disaster recovery, or internal controls could result in significant financial and reputational harm. Meanwhile, COF (Capital One) defines operational risk in its 2024 10-K as the risk of loss, capital impairment, or reputational damage resulting from procedural failures, noncompliance with policies, or external events. This aligns with the broader definition of operational risk outlined in the Morgan Stanley (MS) filing, which includes fraud, cyberattacks, and human factors as key components of operational risk. Both MET and COF recognize fraud and procedural lapses as critical contributors to operational risk, though MET places greater emphasis on vendor-related exposures, while COF frames the issue more broadly around internal compliance and system integrity.",

Our policies and procedures may be ineffective in preventing, detecting or mitigating fraud and other illegal or improper acts.\n\nWe may fail to attract, motivate and retain employees, develop talent, and plan for management succession. Additionally, attrition could cause a lapse in implementation of policies and procedures.\n\nNotwithstanding our compliance with regulatory and accounting requirements in relation to internal controls and our conclusion that internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the date reported, the Company's internal controls have in the past proved, and there is a risk that they may in the future prove, to be deficient or ineffective.\n\n## We May Fail to Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of Our Systems or Data, Including As a Result of a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems, and those of our service providers, vendors, and other third parties. Our business relies on the proper functioning of these systems, including processing claims, transactions and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses, retaining customer and business records and other core business functions. A failure to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of such systems, use by our employees or agents of unauthorized tools, software or other technology to communicate with customers or business counterparties or a failure to maintain the security of our internal or ex ternal vendors' systems, or the confidential information stored thereon, may adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in regulatory enforcement action and litigation, and harm our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\n\nWe, our employees, and our vendors, like other commercial entities, continue to be targeted by or subject to computer viruses or other malicious code, unauthorized or fraudulent access, human errors, ransomware or cyber-attacks, and other breaches or incidents affecting our cybersecurity and information security systems. G lobally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue.  While we have implemented what we believe to be reasonable and appropriate cybersecurity and data protection measures across business lines and at the enterprise level (and we contractually require our critical vendors to implement similar measures), including a formal risk-based information security program, our efforts to minimize the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent material break-ins, attacks, fraud, security breaches or other unauthorized access to our and our vendors' systems, including as a result of software code that contains vulnerabilities, which may increase the potential of cyber attacks or unauthorized access. We may not detect such incidents in a timely manner.\n\nIf we or our vendors fail to prevent, detect, address and mitigate such incidents, we may suffer significant financial and reputational harm. There is no assurance that our  security  measures  or  those  of  our  vendors,  including  information  security  policies,  administrative,  technical  and  physical  controls  and  other  actions  designed  as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from such events.\n\nIn addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means, including customers' confidential healthrelated information. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential and secure, we may be unable to do so in all events, and we or our vendors may also fail to maintain adequate internal controls or comply with relevant policies and procedures designed to ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data. Such failure may result in our or our vendors' intentional or unintentional disclosure or misuse of such personal, confidential or proprietary information, as well as others' misappropriation of such information, which could damage our reputation, reduce demand for our products and services and subject us to significant legal and regulatory liability and expenses, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe, our vendors, our reinsurers, and our customers may suffer disasters such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, ransomware or cyber-attack, or war, and our or their disaster recovery systems may be insufficient to safeguard our ability to conduct normal business operations, obtain reinsurance and maintain our critical business or information technology systems in such circumstances, particularly if such disasters affect computerbased data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and/or destroy or otherwise adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of valuable data or the financial wherewithal of reinsurers or vendors. Our ability to conduct business effectively and maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality, availability or privacy of sensitive data could be severely compromised if, as a result of such disaster, key personnel are unavailable, or our vendors' ability to provide goods and services and our associates' ability to perform their job responsibilities are impaired. We may not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to protect us from all losses that may result from such interruptions, and any insurance for liability, operational and other risks may become less readily available or more expensive in the future.",

      "answer": "BAC invests in CDOs that are part of its broader involvement with VIEs, and while the Corporation does not consolidate these vehicles, it recognizes maximum loss exposure tied to the value of its investment balances. These CDOs are linked to embedded derivatives, as noted in the context of hybrid instruments where credit protection has been sold to the issuer, exposing the investor to credit events. JPM, on the other hand, explicitly discloses that structured notes with embedded derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analyses and models such as Black-Scholes or simulation models, depending on the derivative features. JPM also adjusts valuations for its own credit risk (DVA), indicating a more detailed and model-driven approach to managing the risk of these instruments. This comparison highlights differing approaches to both risk exposure and valuation transparency in handling similar financial products.",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley treats CDOs as hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, where credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note, and if there is a credit event of a reference entity, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full. JPMorgan Chase, on the other hand, values structured notes using discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative features through models like Black-Scholes or simulation models, with adjustments for the Firm's own credit risk (DVA). Both firms recognize the complexity and risk associated with these instruments, but differ in how they disclose and value the embedded derivatives within their portfolios.",

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Firm is involved with various SPEs in the normal course of business. In most cases, these entities are deemed to be VIEs.\n\nThe  Firm's  variable  interests  in  V IEs  include  debt  and  equity  interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. The Firm's involvement with VIEs arises primarily from:\n\n- Interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its  Investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.\n- Guarantees  issued  and  residual  interests  retained  in  connection  with municipal bond securitizations.\n- Loans made to and investments in VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.\n- Derivatives entered into with VIEs.\n- Structuring of CLNs or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.\n- Other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon its initial  involvement  with  the  V IE  and  reassesses  whether  it  is  the  primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the VIE. This determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the  VIE,  including  the  V IE's  structure  and  activities,  the  power  to  make significant economic decisions held by the Firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the Firm and other parties.\n\nThe  power  to  make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  may  take  a number  of  different  forms  in  different  types  of  V IEs.  The  Firm  considers servicing  or  collateral  management  decisions  as  representing  the  power  to make  the  most  significant  economic  decisions  in  transactions  such  as securitizations or CDOs.  As  a result, the Firm does not consolidate securitizations or CDOs for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager  or  to  require  the  liquidation  of  the  entity.  If  the  Firm  serves  as servicer  or  collateral  manager,  or  has  certain  other  rights  described  in  the previous sentence, the Firm analyzes the interests in the VIE that it holds and consolidates  only  those  VIEs  for  which  it  holds  a  potentially  significant interest in the V IE.\n\nFor many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. In these cases, the Firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. The Firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the Firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were  issued  in  a  transaction  sponsored  by  the  Firm  and  the  ex tent  of  the information  available  to  the  Firm  and  to  investors,  the  number,  nature  and involvement  of  investors,  other  rights  held  by  the  Firm  and  investors,  the standardization  of  the  legal  documentation  and  the  level  of  continuing involvement by the Firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the Firm and by other investors. The Firm focused its control decision on any right held by the Firm or investors related to the termination of the VIE. Most re-securitization transactions, CLNs and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.\n\n## Consolidated VIE  Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges\n\nConsistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters-Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroup's equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustmen t (CTA) within AOCI .\n\nFor derivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, including changes related to the forward-rate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are recorded in CTA within AOCI .\n\nFor foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in CTA is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup.\n\n## Economic Hedges\n\nCitigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value included in either Principal transactions or Other revenue .\n\nFor asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.\n\nFor other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swap's value, but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt.\n\nCitigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt's fair value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is automatically captured in current earnings.\n\nAdditional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments.\n\nCitigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked-to-market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs.\n\n## Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned\n\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus accrued interest. As described in Note 27, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending transactions. Fees received or paid for all securities borrowing and lending transactions are recorded in Interest revenue or Interest expense at the contractually specified rate.\n\nWhere the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-1, Balance\n\nSheet-Offsetting: Right of Setoff Conditions , are met, securities borrowing and lending transactions are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Company monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\n\nAs described in Note 26, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions.\n\n## Repurchase and Resale Agreements\n\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale (or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as collateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 27, the Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to certain portions of such transactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair value accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has elected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.\n\nWhere the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet-Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements , are met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Company's policy is to take possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\n\nAs described in Note 26, the Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions.",

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fix ed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest ex pense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixedvariable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $109 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2023. Operating revenues decreased $206 million primarily due to lower gas cost recovery, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses decreased $390 million primarily due to a $412 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $88 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt ex pense, energy efficiency programs, and revenue taxes. The decrease in net income also includes an increase of $46 million in income taxes primarily as a result of higher pre-tax  earnings and an increase of $36 million in interest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Pipeline Investments\n\nThe gas pipeline investments segment consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nThe gas marketing services segment provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $11 million, or 12.1%, compared to 2023. The increase was due to a $43 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating revenues primarily due to lower retail margins.",

The V aR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives).\n\nWe use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio's aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating  a  range  of  varied  market  risks  and  portfolio  assets.  One  key element  of  the  V aR  model  is  that  it  reflects  risk  reduction  due  to  portfolio diversification  or  hedging  activities.  However,  V aR  has  various  limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed  historical  market  behavior  or  reflect  the  historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be  liquidated  or  hedged  in  one  day.  A  small  proportion  of  market  risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR.\n\nThe  modeling of the risk characteristics of some  positions relies  on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different  results  from  those  produced  using  more  precise  measures.  V aR  is most  appropriate  as  a  risk  measure  for  trading  positions  in  liquid  financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use V aR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and  extensive  risk  monitoring,  analysis  and  control  at  the  trading  desk, division and Firm levels.\n\nWe  update  our  V aR  model  in  response  to  changes  in  the  composition  of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of V aR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements,  additional  systematic  and  name-specific  risk  factors  may  be added to improve the V aR model's ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.\n\nSince the reported V aR statistics are estimates based on historical data, V aR should  not  be  viewed  as  predictive  of  our  future  revenues  or  financial performance or of our ability  to  monitor  and  manage  risk.  There  can  be  no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the V aR amounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one-day V aR. V aR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nVaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in  the  firms'  portfolios,  modeling  assumptions  and  methodologies.  These differences  can  result  in  materially  different  V aR  estimates  across  firms  for similar  portfolios.  The  impact  of  such  differences  varies  depending  on  the factor  history  assumptions,  the  frequency  with  which  the  factor  history  is updated and the confidence level. As a result, V aR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm's risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.\n\nOur regulators have  approved  the same  V aR model  we  use  for risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.\n\nThe portfolio of positions used for Management V aR differs from that used for Regulatory VaR. Management  V aR  contains  certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR.\n\n## 95%/One-Day Management VaR\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security's decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time.\n\nOur bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, PALs, and HELOCs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.\n\nHeightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:\n\n- Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;\n- Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and\n- Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index , or industry.\n\nThe Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges, could reduce the Company's liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in the Company having to consolidate one or more funds in its financial statements. If the Company were to choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.\n\n## Compliance Risks\n\nExtensive regulatory supervision of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.\n\nAs a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to ex tensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow.\n\nRegulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC's ability to repurchase or redeem shares. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or ex pulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.",

Our Modeled  Liquidity  Outflow  and  Intraday  Liquidity  Model  incorporate  a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity  held  directly  in  each  of  our  major  broker-dealer  and  bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC  unless  (i) legally provided  for and  (ii) there are no  additional regulatory,  tax  or  other  restrictions.  In  addition,  the  Modeled  Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.\n\nOther  Unencumbered  Assets.

AN D  SU BSID IAR IE S Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Subsidiary Funding Policies\n\nThe majority of our unsecured borrowings is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements.  In  addition,  Group  Inc.  provides  its  regulated  subsidiaries with  the  necessary  capital  to  meet  their  regulatory  requirements.  The benefits  of  this  approach  to  subsidiary  funding  are  enhanced  control  and greater  flexibility  to  meet  the  funding  requirements  of  our  subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\n\nOur  intercompany  funding  policies  assume  that  a  subsidiary's  funds  or securities  are  not  freely  available  to  its  parent,  Funding  IHC  or  other subsidiaries  unless  (i)  legally  provided  for  and  (ii)  there  are  no  additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow  of  funds  from  those  subsidiaries  to  Group  Inc.  or  Funding  IHC. Regulatory  action  of  that  kind  could  impede  access  to  funds  that  Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that  the  capital  provided  to  our  regulated  subsidiaries  is  not  available  to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to  Group  Inc. or  Funding  IHC until the maturity of such financing.\n\nGroup  Inc.  has  provided  substantial  amounts  of  equity  and  subordinated indebtedness,  directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries.  For example,  as  of  December  2024,  Group  Inc.  had  $38.69  billion  of  equity and  subordinated  indebtedness  invested  in  GS&amp;Co.,  its  principal  U.S. registered  broker-dealer;  $47.21  billion  invested  in  GSI,  a  regulated  U.K. broker-dealer;  $2.08  billion  invested  in  GSJCL,  a  regulated  Japanese broker-dealer;  $62.81  billion  invested  in  GS  B ank  USA,  a  regulated  New York State-chartered bank; and $5.30 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $131.82 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $59.97 billion) and $32.92 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities  as  of  December  2024.  In  addition,  as  of  December  2024,  Group Inc.  had  significant  amounts  of  capital  invested  in  and  loans  to  its  other regulated subsidiaries.\n\nContingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide  a  framework  for  analyzing  and  responding  to  a  liquidity  crisis situation  or  periods  of  market  stress.  Our  contingency  funding  plan outlines  a  list  of  potential  risk  factors,  key  reports  and  metrics  that  are reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  assist  in  assessing  the  severity  of,  and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation.  The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our  assessments  indicate  that  we  have  entered  a  liquidity  crisis,  which include  pre-funding  for  what  we  estimate  will  be  our  potential  cash  and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary  sources  of  liquidity. Mitigants  and  action  items  to  address  specific  risks  which  may  arise  are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\n\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution  of  information,  implementing  liquidity  maintenance  activities and  managing  internal  and  external  communication,  all  of  which  are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.\n\n## Stress Tests\n\nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies  our  liquidity  risks  over  a  30-day  stress  scenario.  We  also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our longterm  stress  testing  models,  our  resolution  liquidity  models  and  other applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  a  qualitative  assessment  of  our condition,  as  well  as  the  financial  markets.  The  results  of  the  Modeled Liquidity  Outflow,  the  Intraday  Liquidity  Model,  the  long-term  stress testing  models  and  the  resolution  liquidity  models  are  reported  to  senior management  on  a  regular  basis.  We  also  perform  firmwide  stress  tests. See 'Overview and Structure of Risk Management' for information about firmwide stress tests.",

In many countries, the  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  the  securities  and  financial  services industries and multinational corporations are uncertain, evolving and subject to sudden change or may be inconsistent with U.S. law. It may also be difficult for  us  to  determine  the  ex act  requirements  of  local  laws  in  every  market  or adapt to changes in law, which could adversely impact our businesses. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but  also  on  our  reputation  generally.  We  are  also  subject  to  the  risk  that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\n\nVarious emerging market countries have experienced severe political, economic or financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies,  defaults  or  potential  defaults  on  sovereign  debt,  capital  and currency exchange controls, high rates of inflation and low or negative growth rates in their economies. Crime and corruption, as well as issues of security and personal safety, also exist in certain of these countries. These conditions could  adversely  impact  our  businesses  and  increase  volatility  in  financial markets generally.\n\nA disease pandemic or other widespread health emergencies, natural disasters, climate-related  incidents,  terrorist  activities  or  military  actions,  or  social  or political tensions, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets or in other areas of the global economy that could adversely affect our businesses, or could lead to operational difficulties, including travel limitations and supply chain complications,  that  could  impair  our  ability  to  manage  or conduct our businesses around the world.\n\nAs a U.S. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, which may be inconsistent with local law.  We and certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to applicable AML and/or anti-corruption laws in the U.S., as well as in the jurisdictions in which we  operate,  including  the  Bank  Secrecy  Act,  the  U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. A violation of a sanction, embargo program,  AML  or  anti-corruption  law  could  subject  us,  and  individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action, as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.\n\nDecember 2024 Form 10-K\n\n## Acquisition, Divestiture and Joint Venture Risk\n\nWe may be unable to fully capture the expected value from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, partnerships, minority  stakes or strategic alliances,  and  certain  acquisitions  may  subject  our  business  to  new  or increased risk.\n\nIn  connection  with  past  or  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  joint  ventures, partnerships, minority stakes or strategic alliances (including with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. ('MUFG')), we face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining, transferring, separating or integrating the relevant businesses  and  systems  that  may  present  operational  and  other  risks, including  the  need  to  combine  or  separate  accounting,  data  processing, technology and other systems, management controls and legal entities, and to integrate  relationships  with  clients,  trading  counterparties  and  business partners.  Certain  of  these  strategic  initiatives,  and  integration  thereof,  may cause  us  to  incur  incremental  ex penses  and  may  also  require  incremental financial, management and other resources.\n\nIn the case of joint ventures, partnerships and minority stakes, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties because we may be dependent upon, and subject  to  liability,  losses  or  franchise  and  reputational  damage  relating  to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control, and conflicts or disagreements between us and any of our partners may negatively impact the benefits to be achieved by the relevant partnerships.\n\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions, divestitures or investments will  be  successfully  integrated  or  disaggregated  or  yield  all  of  the  positive benefits  and  synergies  anticipated. If  we  are  not  able  to  integrate  or disaggregate  successfully  our  past  and  future  acquisitions  or  dispositions, including  aligning  the  processes,  policies  and  procedures  of  the  acquired entities  with  our  standards,  there  is  a  risk  that  our  results  of  operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nCertain of our business initiatives, including expansions of existing businesses  or  the  introduction  of  new  products,  may  change  our  client  or account profile or bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base and may expose us to new asset classes, services, competitors and new markets. These  business  activities  expose  us  to  new  and  enhanced  risks,  greater regulatory  scrutiny  of  these  activities,  increased  credit-related,  sovereign, compliance  and  operational  risks,  as  well  as  franchise  and  reputational concerns regarding the manner in which these assets are being operated or held, or services are being delivered.\n\nFor  more  information  regarding  the  regulatory  environment  in  which  we operate, see also 'Business-Supervision and Regulation.'",

      "answer": "SCHW is subject to a stress capital buffer of 2.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, with the countercyclical capital buffer at 0%, resulting in a total buffer requirement of 5.0% above the minimum risk-based capital ratios. JPM, on the other hand, applies a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a stress capital buffer (SCB) of 2.9%, with the countercyclical buffer also at 0%, leading to a total buffer requirement of 5.4% above the minimum. Therefore, JPM has a slightly higher combined buffer requirement than SCHW due to its higher SCB. This comparison reflects how both firms are subject to similar regulatory buffer frameworks, but with firm-specific SCB and CCyB determinations.",

      "question": "How does Morgan Stanley's explicit risk disclosure about differential creditor treatment under the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) compare with JPMorgan Chase's exposure to Dodd-Frank Title II provisions, particularly in light of MetLife's disclosure that OLA permits set-off and close-out netting of derivative exposures without application of the automatic stay?",
      "answer": "Morgan Stanley discloses that under the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), the FDIC has the power to disregard creditor claim priorities and treat similarly situated creditors differently, which could adversely impact holders of its unsecured debt. This is compounded by the fact that the Parent Company's obligations under its support agreement are secured by its assets (excluding shares in subsidiaries), making claims of supported subsidiaries effectively senior to unsecured obligations. MetLife's evidence adds that under Dodd-Frank Title II, OLA permits financial institutions to enforce set-off and close-out netting of derivative exposures without the automatic stay applying, which affects how derivative counterparties can manage risk in a resolution scenario. JPMorgan Chase, as a systemically important financial institution, is also subject to Dodd-Frank Title II and thus exposed to the same OLA provisions, including potential disruptions in derivatives markets where close-out netting is a key risk mitigation tool. Therefore, both firms face similar regulatory risks under OLA, particularly regarding the enforceability of derivatives close-out netting and the potential for unequal treatment of creditors.",

T he  Company has entered into a litigation management deed with  Visa  Europe which sets forth the agreed upon procedures for the management of the VE territory cov ered litigation, the allocation of losses resulting from this litigation (VE territory cov ered losses) between the series B and C preferred stock, and any accelerated conv ersion or reduction in the conv ersion rate of the shares of series B and C preferred stock. The litigation management deed applies only to VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant losses and liabilities). T he litigation management deed provides  that  the  Company  will  generally  control  the  conduct  of  the  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  subject  to  certain  obligations  to  report  and consult with the litigation management committee for VE territory cov ered litigation (VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee). The VE T erritory Litigation  Management Committee, which is composed of representativ es of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory cov ered litigation.\n\nThe  Company  obtained  certain  protections  for  VE  territory  cov ered  losses  through  the  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock,  the  UK  loss  sharing agreement and the litigation management deed (collectiv ely Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan). T he plan cov ers VE territory cov ered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the cov ered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates, where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. T he plan does not protect the Company in Europe against all types of litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law  enforcement  proceedings,  only  the  interchange  litigation  specifically  cov ered  by  the  plan's terms.\n\nUnlike the U.S. retrospectiv e responsibility plan, the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan does not hav e an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recov er VE territory cov ered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The total amount of protection av ailable through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospectiv e responsibility plan is equiv alent to the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conv ersion rate applicable to each series of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs from the v alue of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The book v alue of the preferred stock reflects its historical v alue recorded at the Closing less VE territory cov ered losses recovered through a reduction of the applicable conv ersion rate. T he book v alue does not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa Inc. net income is not impacted by VE territory cov ered losses as long as the as-conv erted v alue of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory cov ered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records a reduction to stockholders' equity in the contra-equity account right to recov er for cov ered losses, which represents the Company's right to recov er such losses through adjustments to the conv ersion rate applicable to the preferred stock.\n\nVE territory cov ered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conv ersion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, indiv idual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conv ersion rate is made, the amount prev iously recorded in right to recov er for cov ered losses is then recorded against the book v alue of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2024, the eighth anniv ersary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE T erritory Litigation Management Committee, carried out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $2.7 billion of the as-conv erted v alue from its series B and C preferred stock and issued 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024 (Eighth Anniversary Release). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock receiv ed a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment div ided by 100. The Company paid $5 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically conv erted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.",

      "question": "How does the composition and risk management strategy of MET's RMBS portfolio compare to COF's investment in Agency Securities, particularly in terms of their exposure to mortgage-backed securities and credit quality?",
      "answer": "MET's RMBS portfolio includes both Agency and Non-Agency securities, with a focus on diversification across subsectors and risk profiles, including prime, sub-prime, and reperforming loans. The majority of MET's RMBS holdings are rated Aaa and designated NAIC 1 or NAIC 2, indicating strong credit quality and low risk. MET manages credit risk through tranche selection, stress testing, and close monitoring. In contrast, COF's investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward Agency securities, which include Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac-backed RMBS, and represented 97% of their total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023. These Agency securities are generally considered lower risk due to government guarantees. Therefore, while both companies hold mortgage-backed securities, MET maintains a more diversified and risk-tiered RMBS portfolio with both Agency and Non-Agency exposure, whereas COF leans heavily on the lower-risk, government-backed Agency securities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MET \u2192 RMBS Portfolio: MET discloses details about its RMBS portfolio, including diversification across security types and risk profiles (e.g., prime, sub-prime, reperforming), with a majority rated Aaa and NAIC 1/2.",
        "Hop 2: RMBS Portfolio \u2192 Agency Securities: The RMBS portfolio includes both Agency (government-backed) and Non-Agency securities, with Agency securities being considered lower risk due to guarantees from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae.",
        "Hop 3: Agency Securities \u2190 COF: COF invests heavily in Agency securities, which made up 97% of its total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023, indicating a strong preference for government-backed, lower-credit-risk mortgage-backed securities."

      "question": "How does Capital One's adoption of ASU 2022-02, which eliminates TDR accounting and introduces prospective disclosure requirements for loans with FDMs, compare to Morgan Stanley's broader obligations under complex disclosure regimes, particularly in terms of how each firm must report credit-related modifications and financial exposures?",
      "answer": "Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, which eliminated the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and introduced prospective disclosure requirements specifically for loans with favorable debt modifications (FDMs), as evidenced by their reporting of modification types, amortized cost amounts, and financial effects of TDRs during 2022. This standard, part of a broader regulatory shift in credit loss reporting, imposes structured disclosure obligations on Capital One related to loan modifications. In contrast, Morgan Stanley, while also subject to extensive disclosure regimes, faces a broader and more systemic set of regulatory requirements that include\u2014but are not limited to\u2014credit loss disclosures. MS highlights exposure to 'wide-ranging regulation and supervision,' including complex sanctions, derivatives regulation, and consumer protection rules, all of which necessitate broad disclosure obligations. The distinction lies in the specificity and scope: Capital One\u2019s obligations under ASU 2022-02 are narrowly focused on loan-level disclosures for certain credit modifications, whereas Morgan Stanley must navigate a multi-dimensional regulatory landscape that demands disclosure across a wide array of financial activities and exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COF \u2192 ASU 2022-02: Capital One adopted ASU 2022-02 in 2023, which eliminated TDR accounting and introduced prospective disclosures for loans with favorable debt modifications (FDMs), including detailed reporting of modification types and financial effects from 2022.",
        "Hop 2: ASU 2022-02 \u2192 Disclosure Requirements: ASU 2022-02 specifically establishes prospective disclosure requirements for loans with FDMs, shifting the focus from historical TDR accounting to forward-looking transparency on credit modifications.",
        "Hop 3: Disclosure Requirements \u2190 MS: Morgan Stanley is subject to a wide range of regulatory disclosure obligations, including those related to credit risk, derivatives, consumer protection, and resolution planning, which go beyond the scope of ASU 2022-02 and apply across its global operations."

These  laws  and  regulations,  which  may  continue  to  increase  in volume  and  complexity,  significantly  affect  the  way  and  costs  of  doing business and can restrict the scope of our existing businesses and limit our ability to ex pand our product offerings and pursue certain investments.\n\nThe  Firm  and  its  employees  are  subject  to  wide-ranging  regulation  and supervision, which, among other things, subject us to intensive scrutiny of our  businesses  and  any  plans  for  ex pansion  of  those  businesses  through acquisitions or otherwise, limitations on activities, a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity and funding requirements, including the  global  implementation  of  capital  standards  established  by  the  Basel Committee, and other enhanced prudential standards, resolution regimes and resolution  planning  requirements,  requirements  for  maintaining  minimum amounts of TLAC and external long-term debt, restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the Volcker Rule, comprehensive derivatives regulation,  interest  rate  benchmark  requirements,  commodities  regulation, market  structure  regulation,  consumer  protection  regulation, AML,  terrorist financing  and  anti-corruption  rules  and  regulations,  tax  regulations  and interpretations,  antitrust  laws,  trade  and  transaction  reporting  obligations, requirements  related  to  preventing  the  misuse  of  confidential  information, including material non-public information, record-keeping requirements, broadened fiduciary obligations and disclosure requirements.\n\nNew laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, as well as ongoing implementation of, our efforts to comply with, and/or changes to laws, rules, regulations  and  guidelines,  including  changes  in  the  breadth,  application, interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold,  impact  our  income  tax   provision  and  effective  tax   rate,  ex pose  us  to additional  theories  of  liability  and  additional  costs,  require  changes  to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors.\n\nIn addition, regulatory requirements that are imposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations  that  we  are subject to in the U.S. and may adversely affect us.\n\nThe  application  of  regulatory  requirements  and  strategies  in  the  U.S.  or other  jurisdictions  to  facilitate  the  orderly  resolution  of  large  financial institutions  may  pose  a  greater  risk  of  loss  for  our  security  holders  and subject us to other restrictions.\n\nWe are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress  or  failure.  If  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  FDIC  were  to  jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject  to  more  stringent  capital,  leverage  or  liquidity  requirements  or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or after a two-year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.\n\nIn addition, provided that certain procedures are met, we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under Title II of the  Dodd-Frank Act  with  the  FDIC  being  appointed  as  receiver  instead  of being resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC's power under the orderly  liquidation  authority  to  disregard  the  priority  of  creditor  claims  and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances, subject to certain limitations, could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt. See 'Business-Supervision  and  Regulation'  and  'Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Regulatory Requirements.'\n\nFurther,  because  both  our  resolution  plan  contemplates  an  SPOE  strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC has indicated that it expects to use  an  SPOE  strategy  through  which  it  may  apply  its  orderly  liquidation authority powers for a U.S. G -SIB, we believe that the application of an SPOE strategy  is  the  reasonably  likely  outcome  if  either  our  resolution  plan  were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority. An SPOE strategy generally contemplates the provision of  adequate  capital  and  liquidity  by  the  Parent  Company  to  certain  of  its subsidiaries  so  that  such  subsidiaries  have  the  resources  necessary  to implement the resolution strategy, and the Parent Company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with such entities, pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities.\n\nIn addition, a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, Morgan Stanley  Holdings  LLC  ('Funding  IHC'),  serves  as  a  resolution  funding vehicle. The Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to the Funding IHC. In the event of a resolution scenario,  the  Parent  Company  would  be  obligated  to  contribute  all  of  its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support",

Meanwhile, SCHW reported nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings recorded prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 still included in their 2023 balance sheets.

      "question": "How does JPMorgan Chase's compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act influence its derivatives-related capital requirements compared to MetLife's exposure to derivatives regulation under the same framework?",
      "answer": "JPMorgan Chase, as a global systemically important bank (GSIB), must comply with the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential standards, including the proposed July 2025 U.S. risk-based capital framework that significantly revises capital requirements for banks with $100 billion or more in assets. Title VII of Dodd-Frank mandates increased regulation of derivatives markets, affecting capital and liquidity planning for firms like JPMorgan Chase. Similarly, MetLife, while not a bank, is also subject to federal derivatives regulation under Dodd-Frank, which influences its capital and risk management strategies, particularly in managing reinsurance and derivatives-linked exposures. Both firms must align their capital planning with the derivatives-related provisions of Dodd-Frank, though JPMorgan Chase faces more direct and stringent capital and liquidity requirements due to its systemic role in the financial system.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JPM \u2192 Dodd-Frank Act: JPMorgan Chase is subject to enhanced prudential standards under Dodd-Frank, including capital requirements tied to its status as a GSIB with over $100 billion in assets, with a proposed new framework effective July 1, 2025.",
        "Hop 2: Dodd-Frank Act \u2192 Derivatives Regulation: Title VII of Dodd-Frank significantly increases regulation of derivatives markets, including reporting, clearing, and margin requirements, which affects firms like JPMorgan Chase and MetLife.",
        "Hop 3: Derivatives Regulation \u2190 MET: MetLife is subject to federal derivatives regulation under Dodd-Frank, which influences its capital and risk management, particularly in reinsurance and derivatives-linked exposures."

      "answer": "Disruptions in third-party technology vendors that support Aladdin's data architecture could delay AIG's implementation timeline and impair operational efficiency. AIG has acknowledged that Aladdin's implementation involves multiple complex workstreams requiring significant time and resource prioritization. Delays could arise from insufficient resources, changes to the program, or sequencing inefficiencies. Since Aladdin's data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, any failure by these vendors to scale and perform in line with Aladdin's growth could compromise the platform's resilience and analytical capabilities. This, in turn, could hinder AIG's ability to achieve anticipated operational improvements and may lead to increased costs or reputational harm.",

      "answer": "The Dodd-Frank Act imposes a 'source of strength' obligation on both MetLife and Capital One as BHCs, but the capital structure implications differ based on their specific regulatory exposures. MetLife has implemented a compensation recoupment policy (effective December 1, 2023) as part of its compliance with the Act, which could impact executive compensation practices and potentially influence internal capital allocation decisions. In contrast, Capital One faces more direct capital structure implications through the proposed LTD (Long-Term Debt) Rule, which would require the company to maintain eligible long-term debt at no less than the greatest of 6% of total risk-weighted assets, 2.5% of total leverage exposure, or 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. These differing regulatory pressures mean that while MetLife's obligations primarily affect governance and compensation practices, Capital One would face more direct capital structure requirements that could constrain liquidity and financing flexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "Stress Tests and Capital Planning. The FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and  Review  (CCAR)  is  designed  to  ensure  that  large  BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times  of  economic  and  financial  stress.  As  required  by  the  FRB,  we perform  an  annual  capital  stress  test  and  incorporate  the  results  into  an annual  capital  plan,  which  we  submit  to  the  FRB  for  review.  See 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital  Capital  Management  -  Capital  Planning  and  Stress  Testing  Process'  in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital  plan.  As  described  in  'A vailable  Information'  below,  summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\n\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions  across  a  range  of  macroeconomic  and  company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB's own stress tests. In December 2024  and  February  2025,  the  FRB  indicated  that  it  intends  to  propose significant changes to the stress test framework in 2025 and, for the 2025 stress  test,  take  steps  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  results  and  to  begin  to improve  model  transparency.  Also  in  December  2024,  trade  groups representing  major  U.S.  banks,  including  us,  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the FRB concerning certain inadequacies with its stress testing process.\n\nUnder the FRB's rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated  assets,  including  us,  the  SCB  applies  to  the  Standardized approach capital requirements. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends.  The  SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission  of  a  capital  plan.  See  'A vailable  Information'  below  and 'Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results  of  Operations  -  Capital  Management  and  Regulatory  Capital'  in Part  II,  Item  7  of  this  Form  10-K  for  information  about  our  SCB requirement.\n\nThe  SCB  rule  requires  a  BHC  to  receive  the  FRB's  approval  for  any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit  its  capital  plan,  which  may  occur  if  the  BHC  determines  there has  been  or  will  be  a  'material  change'  in  its  risk  profile,  financial condition  or  corporate  structure  since  the  plan  was  last  submitted,  or  if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan.\n\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more  that  are  subsidiaries  of  U.S.  G-SIB s,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA,  are required  to  submit  annual  company-run  stress  test  results  to  the  FRB . GSBE  also has its own  capital and stress testing process,  which incorporates  internally  designed  stress  tests  and  those  required  under German  regulatory  requirements  and  the  ECB  Guide  to  Internal  Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally  designed  stress  tests  developed  in  accordance  with  the  PRA 's ICAAP guidelines.\n\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends. U.S. federal and state laws impose  limitations  on  the  payment  of  dividends  by U.S.  depository institutions,  such  as  GS  B ank  USA.  In  general,  the  amount  of  dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the  recent  earnings  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  if  the  total  of  all dividends  declared  by  the  entity  in  any  calendar  year  is  in  excess  of  the current  year's  net  income  combined  with  the  retained  net  income  of  the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the  undivided  profits  test,  a  dividend  may  not  be  paid  in  excess  of  the entity's undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been  paid  out  as  dividends  or  transferred  to  surplus),  unless  the  entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval.\n\nThe applicable  U.S.  banking  regulators  have  authority  to  prohibit  or  limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n\nSource  of  Strength. The  Dodd-Frank  Act  requires  BHCs  to  act  as  a source  of  strength  to  their  U.S.  bank  subsidiaries  and  to  commit  capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the  FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to  provide  it.  Capital  loans  by  a  BHC  to  a  U.S.  subsidiary  bank  are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness  of  the  subsidiary  bank.  In  addition,  if  a  BHC  commits  to  a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB's invoking its source-ofstrength  authority  or  in  response  to  other  regulatory  measures,  that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.",

Under the final rule, the Bank is required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, under the final rule, the Bank's resolution plan submissions are subject to more detailed content requirements and a new credibility standard for the FDIC's evaluation of resolution plans, which is enforceable against the Bank.\n\nIn addition, the OCC has issued enforceable guidelines requiring banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Bank, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial risks but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent.\n\n## Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Proposal\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets, including the Company, to comply with certain long-term debt requirements and so called 'clean holding company' requirements that are designed to improve the resolvability of covered organizations ('L TD Proposal'). If adopted as proposed, the L TD Proposal would require the Company and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greatest of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To qualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt instrument would be required to meet the requirements currently applicable under the rules that apply to U.S. G -SIBs, as well as certain additional requirements. Additionally, the clean holding company requirements included in the L TD Proposal would limit or prohibit the Company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution. It is uncertain when or if a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the LTD Proposal. As a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on the Company and the Bank, remain uncertain.\n\n## Source of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Regulation Y  requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks (this is known as the 'source of strength doctrine'). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and further requires the Federal Banking Agencies to jointly adopt rules implementing this requirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have yet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, but they may do so in the future.\n\n## FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate non-bank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States and based on the recommendation of the Federal  Reserve and other appropriate  Federal  Banking Agencies, determines that doing so is necessary, among other criteria, to mitigate serious adverse effects on  U.S. financial stability.  Upon such a determination, the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate a company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard. The costs of a liquidation of a company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial companies. The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority.\n\n## FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\n\nThe Bank, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ('DIF') maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio ('DRR') for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)",

      "answer": "Schwab executed $15.0 billion in receive-fixed swaps on its Senior Notes to mitigate interest expense exposure in a low-rate environment, reflecting a proactive hedging strategy. The company also maintained an aggregate effective duration of less than one year for its balance sheet assets, including its AFS and HTM securities, which comprised 48% of total assets as of December 31, 2024. Meanwhile, JPMorganChase noted that a prolonged low interest rate environment compresses net interest margins and limits reinvestment in higher-yielding instruments within its investment securities portfolio. This sensitivity suggests that JPMorganChase faces structural duration risk similar to Schwab\u2019s, though Schwab actively hedged its exposure while JPMorganChase emphasized the broader asset-liability management implications. Both firms are exposed to interest rate risk, but their strategies and portfolio compositions reflect different approaches to managing duration in a low-rate scenario.",

(1)\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, S chw ab executed $15.0 billion of receive-fixed sw aps on CS C's S enior Notes to reduce interest expense exposure in a low er interest rate environment. (2)\n\nAFS and HTM securities comprised approximately 48% and 54% of the Company's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated effective duration of the remaining balance sheet assets in aggregate was less than one year as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Economic Value of Equity Simulation\n\nManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, and includes the impact of derivative instruments. While EVE does not have a direct accounting relationship, the measure aims to capture a theoretical value of assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate environments. EV E is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, behavior of non-maturity client cash held on the balance sheet, and pricing assumptions. We use both proprietary and independent thirdparty models to simulate EVE sensitivity and related analyses. We develop and maintain client credits and deposits run-off models internally based on historical experience and prevailing client cash realignment behaviors. We rely on third-party models for interest rate term structure modeling, prepayment speed modeling for mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans, and cash flow projections based on interest income, and contractual maturities.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effectiv e, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market ev ents were to occur.\n\n## Credit\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and gov ernment entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can inv olv e JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses",

We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives, such as market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\n\n- A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n- Information about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n- The statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedging relationships for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nSee  '-  Summary  of  Critical  Accounting  Estimates  -  Derivatives'  for  further  information  on  the  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  derivatives.  See  also 'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Management of Market Risk Exposures - Hedging Activities' for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\n\n## Net Derivative Gains (Losses)\n\nA portion of our derivatives are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\n\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits are accounted for as MRBs and measured at estimated fair value.

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fix ed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest ex pense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixedvariable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $109 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2023. Operating revenues decreased $206 million primarily due to lower gas cost recovery, partially offset by rate increases. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses decreased $390 million primarily due to a $412 million decrease in cost of natural gas as a result of lower gas prices and lower volumes sold compared to 2023 and the $88 million prior year regulatory disallowance at Nicor Gas, partially offset by higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher compensation and benefits expenses, and higher revenue taxes. The decrease in operating expenses also includes costs passed through directly to customers, primarily related to bad debt ex pense, energy efficiency programs, and revenue taxes. The decrease in net income also includes an increase of $46 million in income taxes primarily as a result of higher pre-tax  earnings and an increase of $36 million in interest ex pense, net of amounts capitalized primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects - Nicor Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Pipeline Investments\n\nThe gas pipeline investments segment consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Gas Marketing Services\n\nThe gas marketing services segment provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.\n\nIn 2024, net income increased $11 million, or 12.1%, compared to 2023. The increase was due to a $43 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a decrease in cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $32 million decrease in operating revenues primarily due to lower retail margins.",

The V aR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks (e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives).\n\nWe use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio's aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating  a  range  of  varied  market  risks  and  portfolio  assets.  One  key element  of  the  V aR  model  is  that  it  reflects  risk  reduction  due  to  portfolio diversification  or  hedging  activities.  However,  V aR  has  various  limitations, which include, but are not limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events that are outsized relative to observed  historical  market  behavior  or  reflect  the  historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot be  liquidated  or  hedged  in  one  day.  A  small  proportion  of  market  risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR.\n\nThe  modeling of the risk characteristics of some  positions relies  on approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different  results  from  those  produced  using  more  precise  measures.  V aR  is most  appropriate  as  a  risk  measure  for  trading  positions  in  liquid  financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use V aR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and  extensive  risk  monitoring,  analysis  and  control  at  the  trading  desk, division and Firm levels.\n\nWe  update  our  V aR  model  in  response  to  changes  in  the  composition  of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of V aR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements,  additional  systematic  and  name-specific  risk  factors  may  be added to improve the V aR model's ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.\n\nSince the reported V aR statistics are estimates based on historical data, V aR should  not  be  viewed  as  predictive  of  our  future  revenues  or  financial performance or of our ability  to  monitor  and  manage  risk.  There  can  be  no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the V aR amounts indicated in the following tables or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a 95%/one-day V aR. V aR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.\n\n## December 2024 Form 10-K\n\nVaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in  the  firms'  portfolios,  modeling  assumptions  and  methodologies.  These differences  can  result  in  materially  different  V aR  estimates  across  firms  for similar  portfolios.  The  impact  of  such  differences  varies  depending  on  the factor  history  assumptions,  the  frequency  with  which  the  factor  history  is updated and the confidence level. As a result, V aR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firm's risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.\n\nOur regulators have  approved  the same  V aR model  we  use  for risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations.\n\nThe portfolio of positions used for Management V aR differs from that used for Regulatory VaR. Management  V aR  contains  certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR.\n\n## 95%/One-Day Management VaR\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nCorrelation - Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a deriv ativ e product where the payoff is driv en by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of deriv ativ e (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positiv ely correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negativ ely correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair v alue measurement. Giv en a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair v alue measurement.\n\nThe lev el of correlation used in the v aluation of deriv ativ es with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different ov er different time periods. Furthermore, correlation lev els are dependent on market conditions and could hav e a relativ ely wide range of lev els within or across asset classes ov er time, particularly in v olatile market conditions.\n\nVolatility - Volatility is a measure of the v ariability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index giv en how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in v alue ov er time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Giv en a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair v alue measurement.\n\nThe lev el of v olatility used in the v aluation of a particular option-based deriv ativ e depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the v olatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the deriv ativ e as well as the strike price of the option.\n\nBermudan switch value - The switch v alue is the difference between the overall v alue of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensiv e European swaption and reflects the additional v alue that the multiple exercise dates prov ide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can v ary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch v alue, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair v alue measurement.\n\n192\n\nInterest rate curv e - The interest rate curv e represents the relationship of interest rates ov er differing tenors. The interest rate curv e is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange deriv ativ e cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any deriv ativ e cash flow.\n\nForward price - The forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future deliv ery date, and is such that the v alue of the contract is zero at inception.\n\nThe forward price is used as an input in the v aluation of certain deriv ativ es and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be receiv ed and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the deliv ery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair v alue measurement.\n\n## Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\n\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair v alue) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within lev el 3 of the fair v alue hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within lev el 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobserv able inputs to the ov erall fair v alue measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobserv able or lev el 3 components, observ able components (that is, components that are activ ely quoted and can be v alidated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair v alue due in part to observ able factors that are part of the v aluation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observ able components of lev el 3 financial instruments using securities and deriv ativ e positions that are classified within lev el 1 or 2 of the fair v alue hierarchy; as these lev el 1 and lev el 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activ ities related to such lev el 3 instruments.",

      "answer": "Schwab uses discounted cash flow models that incorporate observable benchmark interest rates and spreads to value fixed income securities like corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities (Hop 1). JPMorganChase explicitly identifies that market fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads can cause losses on available-for-sale securities and compress net interest margins, particularly when central bank rate changes are misaligned with asset/liability pricing (Hop 2). JPMorganChase further categorizes market fluctuations as a core risk factor that affects earnings through valuation volatility of financial instruments (Hop 3). Since Schwab's valuation methodology directly ties to these market-determined inputs, similar interest rate and credit spread movements that concern JPMorganChase would directly impact Schwab's reported fair values and potentially its earnings stability.",

          "chunk_text": "## THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per S hare Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)\n\navailable, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets, and we generally obtain prices from three independent third-party pricing sources for such assets recorded at fair value.\n\nOur primary independent pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposit; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar 'to-be-issued' securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded.\n\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include interest rate swaps, securities sold but not yet purchased, and repurchase liabilities related to client-held fractional shares of equities, ETFs, and other securities, which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Other securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased above in this Note 2 for the treatment of client-held fractional shares). The fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 Financial Instruments for the repurchase liabilities to match the measurement and accounting of the related client-held fractional shares. The fair values of the repurchase liabilities are based on quoted market prices or other observable market data consistent with the related client-held fractional shares. Unrealized gains and losses on client-held fractional shares offset the unrealized gains and losses on the corresponding repurchase liabilities, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statements of income. The Company's liabilities to repurchase client-held fractional shares do not have credit risk, and, as a result, the Company has not recognized any gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income or comprehensive income attributable to instrument-specific credit risk for these repurchase liabilities. The repurchase liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe fair values of interest rate swaps are based on market observable interest rate yield curves. Fair value measurements are priced considering the coupon rate of the fix ed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. V aluation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve. The Company validates its valuations with counterparty quotations from central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses. See Note 17 for additional information on the Company's interest rate swaps.",

Howev er, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\n- fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n- losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\n- the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believ e that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behav ior\n- losses on av ailable-for-sale ('AFS') securities held in the inv estment securities portfolio\n- lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n- less liquidity in the financial markets, and\n- higher funding costs.\n\nAll of these outcomes could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's earnings or its liquidity and capital lev els, and any negativ e outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negativ ely affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to v ariable interest rates. If borrowers of v ariable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to serv icing a higher v olume of delinquent loans.\n\nOn the other hand, a low or negativ e interest rate env ironment may cause:\n\n- net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its inv estment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinv est contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n- unanticipated or adv erse changes in depositor behav ior, which could negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's broader asset and liability management strategy, and\n- a reduction in the v alue of JPMorganChase's mortgage serv icing rights ('MSRs') asset, resulting in decreased rev enues.\n\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensiv e for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase's credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to ev ents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical ev ents and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase's credit spreads will affect, positiv ely or negativ ely, JPMorganChase's earnings on certain liabilities, such as deriv ativ es, that are recorded at fair v alue.\n\n## JPMorganChase's results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.\n\nThe value of securities, deriv ativ es and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market v olatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to v alue certain financial instruments. Subsequent v aluations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prev ailing, may result in significant changes in the v alue of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair v alue. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase's results of operations.\n\nJPMorganChase's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase's exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effectiv e, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market ev ents were to occur.\n\n## Credit\n\nJPMorganChase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\n\nJPMorganChase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and gov ernment entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorganChase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can inv olv e JPMorganChase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorganChase can also be subject to losses",

Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below  could by itself, or combined w ith other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase's business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, w hich could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe principal risk factors that could adv ersely affect JPMorganChase's business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitiv e position or reputation include:\n\n- Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and superv ised financial serv ices industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can hav e on JPMorganChase's business and operations, including JPMorganChase incurring additional costs associated with assessments, lev ies or other governmental charges; the ways in which differences in financial serv ices regulation and superv ision in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can negativ ely impact JPMorganChase's business; the ways in which gov ernmental policies that discourage or penalize business relationships with clients in certain industries, or require specific business practices, can negativ ely affect JPMorganChase's businesses; the penalties and collateral consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorganChase may incur when resolv ing a regulatory inv estigation; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain jurisdictions can negativ ely impact JPMorganChase's operations and financial results; and the losses that security holders and other unsecured creditors will absorb if JPMorganChase were to enter into a resolution.\n- Political risks, including the potential negativ e effects on JPMorganChase's businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political dev elopments.\n- Market risks, including the effects that economic and market ev ents and conditions, political dev elopments, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and market fluctuations can hav e on JPMorganChase's consumer and wholesale businesses and its inv estment and marketmaking\n\npositions and on JPMorganChase's earnings and its liquidity and capital lev els.\n\n- Credit risks, including potential negativ e effects from adv erse changes in the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and central counterparties; the potential for losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions; and potential negativ e impacts from concentrations of credit risk with respect to clients, customers, counterparties and other market participants.\n- Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorganChase's liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorganChase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; and the potential adv erse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorganChase's credit ratings may hav e on its liquidity and cost of funding.\n- Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to maintain the required lev el and composition of capital, or unfav orable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorganChase's ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activ ities.\n- Operational risks, including risks associated with JPMorganChase's dependence on its operational systems and its employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market participants and serv ice prov iders; the potential negativ e effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the failure of internal or external operational systems, the introduction of or changes to products, serv ices and deliv ery platforms or the adoption of new technologies; risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorganChase or by other extraordinary ev ents; risks associated with JPMorganChase's risk management framework and control environment, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its stress testing and financial statements, and controls ov er disclosure and financial reporting;

      "answer": "BlackRock explicitly states that third-party tech vendors are critical to Aladdin's scalability and data integrity, and any failure by these vendors could result in operational difficulties, reputational harm, and loss of clients. AIG, which is implementing Aladdin across multiple complex workstreams, notes that delays or inefficiencies in execution\u2014such as lack of sufficient resources or required changes to the program\u2014could impair its ability to achieve operational improvements and may disrupt its businesses. Both firms identify operational difficulties as a shared risk, but BlackRock attributes the risk to third-party vendor performance, while AIG focuses on internal execution challenges during implementation.",

Furthermore, to be 'well capitalized' under current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10.0% and not be subject to a FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels.\n\n## Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning\n\nCiti is subject to an annual assessment by the FRB as to whether Citigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as sufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful economic and financial conditions, while also meeting obligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes two related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a qualitative evaluation of a firm's abilities to determine its capital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the qualitative assessment, the FRB evaluates firms' capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of capital planning: governance, risk management, internal controls, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions and events, and estimating impact on capital positions. As part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates Citi's capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common share repurchases. The FRB assesses whether Citi has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for its unique risks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including Citi, are subject to a rigorous evaluation of their capital planning process. Firms with weak practices may be subject to a deficient supervisory rating, and potentially an enforcement action, for failing to meet supervisory expectations. For additional information regarding CCAR, see 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on Citi's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the FRB and the general public as to how Citi's regulatory capital ratios might change using a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions as designed by the FRB. In addition to the annual supervisory stress test conducted by the FRB, Citi is required to conduct annual company-run stress tests under the same adverse economic conditions designed by the FRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an estimate of projected revenues, losses, reserves, pro forma regulatory capital ratios and any other additional capital measures deemed relevant by Citi. Projections are required over a nine-quarter planning horizon under two supervisory scenarios (baseline and severely adverse conditions). All risk-based capital ratios reflect application of the Standardized Approach framework under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is required to conduct the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test. The annual stress test consists of a forward-looking quantitative evaluation of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions under several scenarios on Citibank's regulatory capital. This program serves to inform the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as to how Citibank's regulatory capital ratios might change during a hypothetical set of adverse economic conditions and to ultimately evaluate the reliability of Citibank's capital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are required to disclose the results of their company-run stress tests.",

      "question": "How do BAC's capital adequacy thresholds under the PCA framework and JPM's VaR backtesting exceptions under Basel III reflect different dimensions of compliance with updated regulatory capital requirements?",
      "answer": "BAC must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher to be considered 'well capitalized' under the PCA framework, which was updated by Basel III to include higher minimum capital thresholds. These updated Basel III rules also introduced a VaR backtesting requirement, under which JPM observed 13 exceptions over the past 12 months, including 8 in the final quarter of 2023, indicating periods where actual losses exceeded modeled risk estimates. This shows that while BAC focuses on maintaining minimum capital levels to satisfy PCA thresholds, JPM must also ensure its VaR models align with realized market risk, demonstrating two distinct compliance mechanisms under the broader Basel III capital framework.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BAC \u2192 PCA Framework: BAC must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% to be classified as 'well capitalized' under the PCA framework, which incorporates Basel III's updated minimum capital thresholds.",
        "Hop 2: PCA Framework \u2192 Basel III Capital Rules: The Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA framework to raise capital minimums, including a CET1 ratio of 6.5% for well-capitalized institutions, tying PCA directly to Basel III standards.",
        "Hop 3: Basel III Capital Rules \u2190 JPM: JPM is subject to Basel III's VaR backtesting rules and experienced 13 backtesting exceptions in 2023, showing how the same regulatory framework imposes different compliance obligations focused on risk modeling rather than capital thresholds."

      "answer": "JPMorgan employs the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) model under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to estimate operational risk losses at a 99.9% confidence level over a one-year horizon, incorporating internal and external loss data, scenario analysis, and business environment metrics. This includes capturing the impact of external events like business disruptions. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, explicitly integrates physical climate risks\u2014such as those from floods, hurricanes, and rising sea levels\u2014into its broader operational risk framework through oversight by the Climate Risk Committee, which co-chairs the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer. While JPM focuses on quantitative modeling of operational risk, MS emphasizes embedding climate risk into governance and scenario analysis, recognizing physical risks as a source of operational exposure to its facilities and people.",

          "chunk_text": "## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adv erse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external ev ents impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activ ities and can manifest itself in v arious ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary ev ents beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behav ior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of v endors or other third party prov iders to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate lev els in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory env ironments in which it operates.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ('CCOR') Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to gov ern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO') and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitativ e Risk Appetite and are independent of the respectiv e businesses or functions they ov ersee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Gov ernance and Ov ersight Policy that is rev iewed and approv ed by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\n\n## Operational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiv eness of their respectiv e control environment to assess circumstances in which controls hav e failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance')\n\nprov ides ov ersight of and challenge to these ev aluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk ev ents and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes ev aluating the effectiv eness of the control env ironments and reporting the results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitativ e means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk-based capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach ('LDA') statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency and sev erity of operational risk losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss ov er a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence lev el. T he LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses ev en after the issues or business activ ities giv ing rise to the losses hav e been remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational risk capital methodology, which uses the Adv anced Measurement Approach ('AMA'), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and ev aluation of key business env ironment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and dev elops a forward looking v iew of material operational risk ev ents that may occur in a stressed env ironment. The Firm's operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97-107 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\n## Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with",

          "chunk_text": "Citi is not subject to payout limitations as a result of the U.S. Basel III requirements.\n\n## Stress Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to the FRB's Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule, which integrates the annual stress testing requirements with ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The SCB equals the peak-to-trough CET1 Capital ratio decline under the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario over a nine-quarter period used in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and DoddFrank Act Stress Testing (DFAST), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. SCB-based capital requirements are reviewed and updated annually by the FRB as part of the CCAR process. For additional information regarding CCAR and DFAST, see 'Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning' below. The fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer will continue to apply under the Advanced Approaches (see below).\n\nAs of October 1, 2024, Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 12.1% from 12.3% under the Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.1% SCB through September 30, 2025 and Citi's current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi's required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) remains unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup's SCB.\n\n## Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Capital Buffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to a fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under the Advanced Approaches. Citibank is subject to the fix ed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer under both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized Approach.\n\nIn addition, Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as Citigroup and Citibank, are subject to a discretionary Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The Countercyclical Capital Buffer is currently set at 0% by the U.S. banking agencies.\n\n## GSIB Surcharge\n\nThe FRB imposes a risk-based capital surcharge upon U.S. bank holding companies that are identified as GSIBs, including Citi (for information on potential changes to the GSIB surcharge, see 'Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments' and 'Risk Factors-Strategic Risks' below). The GSIB surcharge augments the SCB, Capital Conservation Buffer and, if invoked, any Countercyclical Capital Buffer.\n\nCiti, as a G SIB, is annually required to calculate a surcharge using two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. The first method (method 1) is based on the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology. Under the second method (method 2), the substitutability category under the Basel Committee's GSIB methodology is replaced with a quantitative measure intended to assess a GSIB's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. In addition, method 1 incorporates relative measures of systemic importance across certain global banking organizations and a year-end spot foreign exchange rate, whereas method 2 uses fixed measures of systemic importance and application of an average foreign exchange rate over a three-year period. The GSIB surcharges calculated under both method 1 and method 2 are based on measures of systemic importance from the year immediately preceding that in which the GSIB surcharge calculations are being performed (e.g., the method 1 and method 2 GSIB surcharges calculated during 2025 will be based on 2024 systemic indicator data). Generally, Citi's surcharge determined under method 2 will be higher than its surcharge determined under method 1.\n\nShould a GSIB's systemic importance change year-over-year, such that it becomes subject to a higher GSIB surcharge, the higher surcharge would become effective on January 1 of the year that is one full calendar year after the increased G SIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a higher surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would not become effective until January 1, 2027). However, if a GSIB's systemic importance changes such that the GSIB would be subject to a lower surcharge, the GSIB would be subject to the lower surcharge on January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year in which the decreased GSIB surcharge was calculated (e.g., a lower surcharge calculated in 2025 using data as of December 31, 2024 would become effective January 1, 2026).\n\nThe following table presents Citi's effective GSIB surcharge as determined under method 1 and method 2 during 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

      "answer": "Morgan Stanley has invested in CLNs where they effectively sell credit protection to the issuer, meaning that if a credit event occurs on the reference entity, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full. This creates a direct credit risk exposure for MS. In contrast, JPM purchases credit protection via instruments like credit derivatives and credit-related notes, where the issuer of the note buys protection from the investor, reducing JPM\u2019s exposure to credit events. JPM actively manages this risk by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities, including through CLNs, to offset potential losses. Thus, while MS assumes risk by selling protection through CLNs, JPM mitigates risk by buying protection, often using similar instruments.",

        "Hop 1: MS \u2192 CLNs: MS invests in CLNs where they sell credit protection to the issuer, exposing them to potential losses if a reference entity experiences a credit event.",

Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup's own credit spreads (DV A) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 21 for additional information.\n\nAmong other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company's credit spreads.\n\nThe estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company's own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss of $573 million and a loss of $2,078 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company's current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.\n\n## The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\n## Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings\n\nThe Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fix ed income securities purchased under\n\nThe following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:\n\n",

      "answer": "Schwab directly implements cybersecurity procedures through a combination of internal and external teams, security software tools, and processes to identify, assess, and manage material cybersecurity risks. The company maintains control over its technology systems and has not experienced material impacts from prior cybersecurity events. In contrast, PayPal relies on third-party custodians to safeguard customer cryptocurrency assets and explicitly states that operational disruptions or failures by these custodians to maintain effective controls or safeguard holdings could expose PayPal and its customers to losses, reduce consumer confidence, and materially impact its operating results. While Schwab manages cybersecurity risk internally, PayPal's exposure is intermediated through custodian partners, increasing its dependency on third-party operational integrity and regulatory compliance.",

      "question": "How does MET's risk exposure to ABS in its Structured Products portfolio compare to C's quantitative ABS holdings in terms of unrealized gains and losses?",
      "answer": "MET discloses that its Structured Products portfolio, which includes ABS, is subject to significant financial statement risks such as credit, interest rate, liquidity, and market valuation risks. These risks affect the determination of ACL and impairments, which are highly subjective and based on quarterly evaluations. In contrast, C's 2024 disclosures show that its ABS holdings totaled $531 million at the end of 2023, with $12 million in unrealized gains still held. While MET emphasizes qualitative and risk-based concerns around ABS valuation and impairments, C provides concrete figures showing a relatively modest unrealized gain position, highlighting different aspects of ABS exposure between the two firms.",

MLIC also charges the closed block for expenses of maintaining the policies included in the closed block.\n\n## 11. Investments\n\nSee Note 13 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\n\n## Investment Risks and Uncertainties\n\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL and impairments, the recognition of income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to these financial statement risks may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\n\nThe  recognition  of  income  on  certain  investments  (e.g.  structured  securities,  including  mortgage-backed  securities,  ABS  &amp;  CLO,  certain  structured  investment transactions and FVO securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\n\n## Fixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\n\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock. RMBS includes agency, prime, prime investor, non-qualified residential mortgage, alternative, reperforming and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. ABS &amp; CLO includes securities collateralized by consumer loans, corporate loans, broadly syndicated bank loans, and other assets. Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to a much lesser extent, general obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. Commercial mortgage-backed securities ('CMBS') primarily includes securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans. RMBS, ABS &amp; CLO and CMBS are, collectively, 'Structured Products.'",

      "question": "How does the 5% weighted average yield COF reports for its CMBS holdings reflect the risks MET identifies in its commercial mortgage loan portfolio, given the structural composition of CMBS as securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans?",
      "answer": "COF reports a 5% weighted average yield for its CMBS holdings, derived from discounted cash flow valuations using yield assumptions ranging from 5-7%. This yield reflects the underlying performance of commercial mortgage loans, which MET explicitly states are negatively impacted by factors like declining property values, tenant creditworthiness, and market volatility. Since CMBS are structured as securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans\u2014as MET clarifies in its disclosures\u2014the risks MET identifies in its commercial mortgage loan portfolio (such as reduced tenant demand or credit deterioration) directly affect the cash flows and default rates of the underlying loans in COF's CMBS holdings. This creates a cascading risk where MET's identified real estate market vulnerabilities could reduce the actual yield COF realizes below its modeled 5% estimate.",

        "Hop 3: Commercial Mortgage Loans \u2190 MET: MET identifies specific risks in its commercial mortgage loan portfolio, including declining property values, tenant creditworthiness, and market volatility, which can reduce cash flows and increase default rates."
